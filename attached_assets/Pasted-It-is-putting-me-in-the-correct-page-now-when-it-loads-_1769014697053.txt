It is putting me in the correct page now when it loads, but none of the left navigation links work. They all just reload the same Platform Admin page

Yep — that symptom is almost always one of two wiring bugs:

All nav items are pointing to the same href (often /app/platform got hardcoded during the refactor), or

The sidebar is rendering items correctly but the click handler is doing navigate(currentPath) / preventDefault() and swallowing the route change (common if they refactored the sidebar into a “button list” and forgot to pass the to).

Either way: the router isn’t actually being fed unique paths, so every click lands back on the same Platform Admin route.

What your screenshots strongly suggest

The sidebar is showing Founder Nav ON and a bunch of items.

Clicking any item “reloads” Platform Admin rather than navigating.
That usually means the link to value is either:

'/app/platform' for every item, OR

'#', OR

undefined (so the component falls back to a default route), OR

a navigate('/app/platform') is executed in the shared onClick.

✅ REPLIT PROMPT — Fix Left Nav Navigation (All links route to /app/platform)

Problem: In the V3.5 shell, the left navigation renders but every item routes back to the Platform Admin page (/app/platform). Clicking links either reloads the same route or navigates to the same route.

Goal: Make every nav link navigate to its correct route. Ensure the sidebar uses real router links (Link/NavLink) with distinct to paths. Validate all routes exist.

1) Find the Sidebar component and confirm what it uses for navigation

Search for the sidebar used on /app/platform:

Sidebar

AppSidebar

TenantAppLayout

PlatformAdminLayout

NavItem

SidebarItem

Open the component and locate how click routing is performed:

Is it using <a href=...>?

Is it using navigate(...)?

Is it using <Link to=...> / <NavLink to=...>?

If it’s NOT using react-router’s Link/NavLink, change it to use Link/NavLink.

2) Diagnose the nav data source and confirm distinct hrefs

Find the nav arrays:

client/src/lib/routes/v3Nav.ts (V3)

any ADMIN_NAV definition

any FOUNDERS_NAV / FOUNDER_NAV

Print/log the nav items once (temporary):

verify each item has a unique href/to

ensure none are all '/app/platform'

Common bug: the new wiring mapped href incorrectly (e.g. href: basePath for all items).

Fix the mapping so each item uses its own route path.

3) Fix the link rendering so it uses the item path (not a constant)

In the sidebar item component, ensure it uses:

React Router:

<NavLink to={item.href}>...</NavLink>

NOT:

<a href="/app/platform">

navigate('/app/platform')

navigate(basePath) where basePath is /app/platform

onClick={() => navigate(activeRoute)}

Also ensure you are NOT calling event.preventDefault() unless you still navigate to item.href.

4) Fix nested routing: ensure layouts render an <Outlet />

If routes are nested under a layout (common):

PlatformAdminLayout and TenantAppLayout must render <Outlet /> where child routes show.
If <Outlet /> is missing, navigation may appear to “work” but always shows the parent page.

Check:

PlatformAdminLayout.tsx includes <Outlet />

The router config nests routes properly.

5) Confirm every sidebar target route exists

If nav items point to routes that don’t exist, React Router may fall back to the nearest matching parent route (/app/platform).

For each nav item path (examples):

/app/platform/tenants

/app/platform/users

/app/platform/portals

etc.

Ensure there is a Route element registered for it.

6) Acceptance tests (must pass)

Clicking “Tenants” changes URL and renders the tenants page.

Clicking “Users” changes URL and renders the users page.

Clicking any founder nav item changes URL and shows its page.

Browser back/forward works.

Active nav highlighting works (NavLink active state).

Deliverables

List the files changed

Confirm whether it was:

nav item href bug

link rendering bug

missing <Outlet />

missing route registrations

If you want the 30-second “most likely fix”

Tell Replit to specifically check these first:

SidebarItem uses navigate('/app/platform') or hardcoded href

v3Nav.ts items all have href: '/app/platform' due to a bad mapping

PlatformAdminLayout missing <Outlet />

Those three account for ~95% of this exact behavior.

One extra note (important)

Your screenshot shows two different left nav sets (“Fleet/Assets/CRM/Compliance/Admin” vs “Personal/Operations/Reservations/Work”). That means the toggle is changing the nav list, but the click handler is ignoring the item path. So the bug is almost certainly in the sidebar item component (one place to fix).
