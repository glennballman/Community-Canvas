REPLIT AUDIT PROMPT — V3.5 Provider Publish Modal UI Stack & Integration Points

ROLE: UI Architect + Repo Auditor (read-only)
MODE: Evidence-first. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT refactor. Do NOT change schema.
GOAL: Determine the exact UI stack and the correct integration points for implementing the Provider “Publish service run” modal with grouping (tenant_owned vs community) and STEP 7 suggestions.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Identify the UI framework + component stack used for modals/dialogs:
   - Is this React? (confirm)
   - Which router? (React Router / Next / other)
   - Which component library is used for modals? (shadcn/ui Dialog, Radix directly, MUI, Chakra, Headless UI, custom)
   - Which styling system? (Tailwind, CSS modules, styled-components, etc.)
   - Any existing “Modal” wrapper component? (name + path)

2) Find where service provider runs are displayed (the page + component):
   - Locate the route/page for provider runs list / ops board
   - Provide file paths and component names
   - Identify the existing “Publish” button (if present) and where it is rendered

3) Find any existing publish-related UI:
   - Search for components/pages that call:
     - GET /api/provider/portals
     - POST /api/provider/runs/:id/publish
     - GET /api/provider/runs/:id/publish-suggestions
     - POST /api/provider/runs/:id/visibility-preview
     - POST /api/provider/runs/:id/unpublish
   - List file paths and the functions/hooks used (fetch wrapper, react-query, SWR, etc.)

4) Identify the API client pattern:
   - Is there a shared api.ts client? (path)
   - Does the app use react-query? SWR? custom hooks?
   - Provide the exact helper function for calling APIs (signature + example usage)

5) Identify i18n/copy token system:
   - Is there a copy token file (e.g., publicCopy.ts, copy.ts, strings.ts)?
   - How are copy strings accessed? (t('key'), copy.key, etc.)
   - Provide file paths and a short example.

6) Output format (REQUIRED):
Return a concise audit report with:

A) UI Stack Summary
- Framework:
- Modal/Dialog system:
- Styling:
- State/data fetching:

B) Provider Runs UI Location
- Route(s):
- Page file(s):
- Component(s):
- Where to attach “Publish” button:

C) Existing Publish UI (if any)
- Files and components:
- APIs called:

D) API Client Pattern
- Files:
- Example call pattern:

E) Copy/i18n Pattern
- Files:
- Example usage:

F) Recommendation
- The single best place to implement the new Publish modal component
- The best place to add copy tokens

SEARCH COMMANDS TO RUN (use ripgrep):
- rg -n "provider/runs" client/src
- rg -n "publish-suggestions" client/src
- rg -n "/api/provider/portals" client/src
- rg -n "visibility-preview" client/src
- rg -n "Dialog" client/src
- rg -n "Modal" client/src
- rg -n "shadcn" client/src
- rg -n "radix" client/src
- rg -n "react-query|@tanstack/react-query|SWR|useQuery|useMutation" client/src
- rg -n "publicCopy|copy|i18n|t\\(" client/src

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT modify code.
- Do NOT implement the modal.
- Only report findings with file paths, component names, and brief excerpts (max 10 lines per excerpt).
