I need a complete audit of all routes, pages, and navigation in the BC Staging Network app. Generate a comprehensive report.

## Step 1: Find All Route Definitions
```bash
echo "=== ROUTE DISCOVERY ==="
echo ""
echo "--- App.tsx Routes ---"
grep -n "Route path=" client/src/App.tsx 2>/dev/null || grep -n "path:" client/src/App.tsx 2>/dev/null || cat client/src/App.tsx | grep -A2 -B2 "Route"

echo ""
echo "--- All Route Files ---"
find client/src -name "*.tsx" -exec grep -l "Route\|useNavigate\|useParams\|Link to=" {} \;
```

## Step 2: Find All Page Components
```bash
echo ""
echo "=== PAGE COMPONENTS ==="
echo ""
echo "--- Pages Directory Structure ---"
find client/src/pages -name "*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | sort

echo ""
echo "--- Components that might be pages ---"
find client/src/components -name "*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

## Step 3: Find Navigation Components
```bash
echo ""
echo "=== NAVIGATION COMPONENTS ==="
echo ""
echo "--- Files with navigation/menu/nav in name ---"
find client/src -name "*[Nn]av*" -o -name "*[Mm]enu*" -o -name "*[Ss]idebar*" 2>/dev/null

echo ""
echo "--- Header/Layout files ---"
find client/src -name "*[Hh]eader*" -o -name "*[Ll]ayout*" 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 4: Extract All Link Destinations
```bash
echo ""
echo "=== ALL LINK DESTINATIONS ==="
echo ""
echo "--- Links in navigation components ---"
grep -rh "to=\"/" client/src/components/*[Nn]av* client/src/components/*[Mm]enu* client/src/components/*[Hh]eader* client/src/components/*[Ss]idebar* 2>/dev/null | grep -oE 'to="[^"]*"' | sort | uniq

echo ""
echo "--- All Links across app ---"
grep -rh "to=\"/" client/src/ 2>/dev/null | grep -oE 'to="[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

## Step 5: Find API Endpoints (for understanding data flows)
```bash
echo ""
echo "=== API ROUTES ==="
echo ""
echo "--- Server route files ---"
ls -la server/routes/ 2>/dev/null

echo ""
echo "--- All API endpoints defined ---"
grep -rh "router\.\(get\|post\|put\|delete\)" server/routes/*.ts 2>/dev/null | head -50

echo ""
echo "--- API endpoints called from frontend ---"
grep -roh "fetch(['\"][^'\"]*['\"]" client/src/ 2>/dev/null | sort | uniq
```

## Step 6: Database Tables (for understanding data model)
```bash
echo ""
echo "=== DATABASE TABLES ==="
echo ""
echo "--- All staging tables ---"
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/staging/search?limit=1" > /dev/null && echo "API Running" || echo "API Not Running"
```

Run this SQL to list all tables:
```sql
SELECT table_name, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = t.table_name) as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'staging_%' OR table_name LIKE 'civos_%'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

## Step 7: Generate Navigation Map

After running the above, create a markdown report with:

1. **Currently Routed Pages** - Pages that have routes in App.tsx
2. **Orphan Pages** - Page components that exist but have no route
3. **Navigation Links** - What's actually linked in nav menus
4. **Missing Links** - Routes that exist but aren't in any navigation
5. **Dead Links** - Navigation links pointing to non-existent routes

Format as a table:

| Page/Route | Has Route? | In Nav? | Status |
|------------|------------|---------|--------|
| /staging | ✅ | ✅ | Active |
| /admin/civos | ✅ | ✅ | Active |
| /fleets | ✅ | ❌ | Orphan |
| etc... | | | |

Also list:
- Current sidebar/nav menu structure
- Recommended unified navigation structure
- Pages that need to be built vs pages that exist but aren't linked
