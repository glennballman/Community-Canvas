# TASK: GLOBAL SEMANTIC RENAME (Tables Empty) — Jobs/Opportunities → Work Requests / Work Orders (+ Optional Projects)

All non-infrastructure tables are basically empty. This is our best window to rename terminology and schema safely.
We must eliminate the word “job” for service contracts because we will also support overseas “job postings” for hiring.

## Decisions (LOCKED)
- Replace “Opportunity/Opportunities” with **Work Request/Work Requests**
- Replace “Job/Jobs” (service delivery unit) with **Work Order/Work Orders**
- Replace “Co-op/Cooperative” with **Shared Run/Shared Runs** (if not already completed)
- Preserve “Service Run” as the umbrella term

## Optional (DO IF EASY AND CLEAN)
- Introduce “Project” as a container for a property/customer/site where multiple Work Requests live.
- If the repo already has “projects” anywhere, report conflicts first.

---

# Step 1 — Discovery (must output evidence)
Run repo-wide search and list hits (paths + counts) for:
- "opportunity", "opportunities"
- "job", "jobs"
- "gig", "gigs"
- "project", "projects"
- "coop", "co-op", "cooperative" (if not fully done)
Also search DB/migrations for:
- opportunities table
- job_* tables or columns
- enums containing job/opportunity terminology

Deliver: a short “Rename Surface Map” listing:
- UI strings
- TS types
- API routes
- DB table/column names
- enums

---

# Step 2 — UI + Copy rename (no behavior changes)
Replace all user-facing copy:
- “Opportunities” → “Work Requests”
- “Opportunity” → “Work Request”
- “Jobs” → “Work Orders”
- “Job” → “Work Order”
Rules:
- Do not rename “job posting” if it exists for recruiting (flag it separately).
- Do not change layout. Only text + labels.

---

# Step 3 — Code rename (types + variables)
Replace internal identifiers where safe:
- opportunity → workRequest
- opportunities → workRequests
- job → workOrder (ONLY for service delivery objects; do not touch employment contexts)
- jobs → workOrders

Update:
- TS interfaces/types
- component names
- filenames if appropriate (optional; only if it reduces confusion)
- route components that display lists/details

---

# Step 4 — API route rename (keep backward compatibility temporarily)
If server routes exist like:
- /api/opportunities
Rename to:
- /api/work-requests

BUT: To avoid breaking any older calls during transition:
- Keep the old endpoint as an alias that calls the new handler.
- Add a TODO comment “remove alias after launch stabilization”.

Same for /api/jobs if it exists:
- Rename to /api/work-orders
- Keep alias temporarily.

---

# Step 5 — DB schema rename (tables empty, do clean rename)
If tables exist:
- opportunities → work_requests
- job_* (service delivery) → work_orders_* where appropriate

If columns exist:
- opportunity_id → work_request_id
- job_id → work_order_id

If enums exist:
- opportunity_status → work_request_status
- job_status → work_order_status

Implement as proper SQL migrations.
Since tables are empty, it’s acceptable to:
- rename tables/columns/enums directly rather than copy/backfill.

---

# Step 6 — Verification (MANDATORY)
Provide:
1) Full list of files changed
2) Grep proof: no remaining UI copy showing “Opportunities” or “Jobs” for service delivery
3) Route smoke test PASS/FAIL for:
   - the main Work Requests list page (formerly opportunities)
   - the Work Request detail page
   - any Work Orders surface (if exists)
   - Service Runs pages still working
4) Confirm no console errors

BEGIN.
