STOP. Your implementation has critical bugs.

WHAT I SEE (WRONG):
1. I'm impersonating Bamfield Community
2. Left sidebar shows community nav ✓
3. BUT main content shows "Your Places" tenant picker 
4. There's a duplicate header inside the main content
5. Borders and lines don't align

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:
When impersonating Bamfield Community:
1. Redirect to /app/dashboard (NOT /app)
2. Show the COMMUNITY DASHBOARD content (Pending Service Runs, Active Service Runs, Opted-in Businesses)
3. NO duplicate headers - the sidebar already has the branding
4. NO tenant picker visible - a tenant IS selected (the impersonated one)

THE BUGS:

BUG 1: Wrong redirect destination
After impersonation starts, you're redirecting to /app instead of /app/dashboard.
Fix: window.location.href = '/app/dashboard';

BUG 2: TenantPicker rendering when it shouldn't
TenantPicker should ONLY render when:
- Route is exactly /app AND
- No currentTenant is set AND  
- Not impersonating

When impersonating, currentTenant SHOULD be set to the impersonated tenant.

BUG 3: Duplicate header in main content
The TenantPicker has its own header with "Community Canvas" logo. This creates duplicate UI when rendered inside TenantAppLayout which already has the logo in the sidebar.

FIX:
The TenantPicker should be a STANDALONE page that renders WITHOUT the sidebar layout.
The Dashboard should render INSIDE the sidebar layout.

CORRECT ROUTING LOGIC:
```tsx
// In App.tsx or route config
<Route path="/app" element={<TenantAppLayout />}>
  {/* TenantPicker is the INDEX route - shows when no tenant selected */}
  <Route index element={<TenantPickerGuard />} />
  
  {/* All other routes require a tenant to be selected */}
  <Route path="dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
  {/* ... other routes ... */}
</Route>

// TenantPickerGuard component
function TenantPickerGuard() {
  const { currentTenant } = useTenant();
  
  // If tenant is selected (including via impersonation), redirect to dashboard
  if (currentTenant) {
    return <Navigate to="/app/dashboard" replace />;
  }
  
  // Only show picker if no tenant selected
  return <TenantPicker />;
}
```

BUG 4: TenantPicker has its own header
Remove the header from TenantPicker. It should NOT have:
- Logo
- "Platform Admin" link  
- User menu

Those belong in the sidebar ONLY.

TenantPicker should be JUST the content:
- "Your Places" heading
- Grouped tenant cards
- Quick actions

The parent layout handles all navigation/branding.

VERIFICATION AFTER FIX:
1. Start impersonation on Bamfield Community
2. Should redirect to /app/dashboard
3. Should see Community Dashboard content (service runs stats, NOT revenue)
4. Should see ONE header/logo in sidebar
5. Should NOT see "Your Places" anywhere
6. Borders and elements should align cleanly
