PROMPT D — STOP GUESSING. PRINT TENANT CONTEXT + SQL + COUNTS FOR /api/schedule/resources

We have a reproducible bug:
- /admin/inventory shows Ballman Enterprises has unified_assets (F550 Truck, Lucky Lander).
- While impersonating Ballman Enterprises, /app/operations shows “No resources found”.

This must be resolved by hard evidence, not assumptions.

TASK 1 — Add temporary debug output to BOTH endpoints
A) In server/routes/admin-inventory.ts (the endpoint used by /admin/inventory):
- Add a debug log (dev-only) that prints:
  - route name
  - resolved tenant id used for filtering/joining
  - count of unified_assets returned for that tenant
  - first 3 asset ids + names + owner_tenant_id

B) In server/routes/schedule.ts (GET /api/schedule/resources):
- Add the same debug log fields:
  - route name
  - resolved tenant id
  - EXACT where clause being used (owner_tenant_id vs tenant_id)
  - count returned
  - first 3 asset ids + names + owner_tenant_id

Guard logs so they only run in dev:
- if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') { console.log(...) }

TASK 2 — Ensure schedule resources query matches canonical ownership rules
The schedule resources query MUST be:
SELECT ... FROM unified_assets
WHERE owner_tenant_id = <resolvedTenantId>
AND (status is not filtering out all rows)
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT <reasonable>

Do NOT filter by tenant_id unless that column truly exists and is correct.
Do NOT require operational_status unless you coalesce it:
- treat NULL as 'active' for now.

TASK 3 — Confirm impersonation tenant context is being applied
- Compare how admin-inventory obtains tenant id vs schedule route.
- Both must use the SAME helper / middleware to resolve the current tenant under impersonation.
- If admin-inventory uses something like req.context.tenantId but schedule uses req.user.tenant_id (or vice versa), fix schedule to use the canonical tenant resolver.

TASK 4 — UI request verification (one-time)
In the client, in OperationsBoard resource fetch:
- Log (dev only) the HTTP status code and response body length for /api/schedule/resources.
- If 401/403 occurs, show a visible banner “Auth error loading resources” (for debugging only).
- Ensure it uses the same fetch helper as other authenticated pages.

Acceptance criteria:
1) While impersonating Ballman Enterprises, calling GET /api/schedule/resources returns >= 2 resources (F550 + Lucky Lander).
2) Operations Board renders those rows.
3) Debug logs show the SAME tenant id on admin-inventory and schedule/resources.

After implementing, reply with:
- The debug output from both routes (tenant id + counts)
- The exact root cause found (tenant mismatch, wrong column, auth header, over-filtering)
- The exact file + line changes
