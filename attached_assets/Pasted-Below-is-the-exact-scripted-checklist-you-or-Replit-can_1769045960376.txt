Below is the exact scripted checklist you (or Replit) can follow without getting lost, plus the one Replit prompt to force it to stop “inventing” and instead collect hard evidence.

The Only QA You Must Run (A2.7 Certification = 5 checks)
Preconditions (2 minutes)

Login as ellen@example.com
 / ellen123! (contractor-admin persona)

Go to /app/contractor/photo-bundles and ensure list loads.

Pick any bundle (doesn’t matter which) and open it.

QA-1 Back-compat render + recompute (mandatory)

Goal: old ingestion IDs don’t break rendering.

Steps:

Open a bundle detail page.

Click Recompute.

Pass if:

thumbnails render

timeline renders

no “missing media” error toast

page does not crash

If it fails: we don’t guess. We capture:

failing API response (status + JSON error)

console error

the bundle record (beforeMediaIds/afterMediaIds)

QA-2 Completeness + confirm gating (mandatory)

Steps:

Ensure bundle is incomplete (missing after).

If not incomplete, use Move to move the only “after” item out of after → during.

Click Recompute.

Expect:

status = incomplete

missingStage = after

Move an item back into after so you have before+after.

Click Recompute.

Expect:

status becomes complete

Try Confirm while incomplete (force it incomplete again) → must be blocked.

Pass if:

confirm is blocked when incomplete (UI + server)

confirm succeeds only when complete

QA-3 Move integrity (mandatory)

Steps:

Pick a single item and move it:

before → during → after

After each move:

verify it appears exactly once across all stages.

Pass if:

no duplicates

no disappearance

recompute doesn’t reintroduce duplicates

QA-4 Messaging invariant (mandatory)

This is the one Replit keeps bungling.

Steps (in bundle detail page):

Click Recompute

Click Confirm (only if complete)

Click Request Missing

Pass if:

all 3 actions post into the same thread

each message includes bundleId + action + status/missing prompts

no second thread created

If this fails, it’s automatically not certified.

QA-5 Quality score sanity (mandatory quick check)

Steps:

Compare two items:

one with timestamp+geo

one missing both

Pass if:

timestamp+geo meaningfully higher

resolution/size don’t dominate

No deep math required. Just “feels right.”
