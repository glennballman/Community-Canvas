🔹 PROMPT A1 — Contractor Onboarding Entry Point (Camera-First)
PURPOSE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Create a camera-first contractor onboarding entry point that:

Requires zero forms

Delivers immediate operational value

Feels easier than a sticky note

Funnels contractors directly into:

Fleet onboarding

Tool onboarding

Sticky-note → Service Run creation

This is the first impression contractors get of the platform.
If this is boring, we’ve already failed.

SCOPE
New Routes

Frontend

/contractor/onboard

Backend

No new business logic yet (this prompt wires UX + routing + session validation only)

Who Can Access

Authenticated users with:

contractor_admin

contractor_worker

Invited but not yet “fully onboarded” contractors

Platform admins impersonating contractors (for Cold Start testing)

ENTRY CONDITIONS

When a contractor logs in:

If contractor_onboarding_complete = false

Redirect automatically to /contractor/onboard

If true

Skip onboarding and go to contractor dashboard

Add:

contractor_onboarding_complete boolean default false


to the contractor profile if not already present.

UX REQUIREMENTS (ABSOLUTE)
❌ DO NOT

Show a form

Ask for company name

Ask for address

Ask for skills

Ask for certifications

Ask for availability

Ask for anything that smells like CRM

✅ DO

Show three giant actions

Lead with the camera

Allow skipping any step

Allow steps in any order

UI LAYOUT
Page Title

“Let’s get you working.”

Subtext:

This takes less time than writing a sticky note.

Primary Actions (Cards / Buttons)

Render three equal-weight action cards, each tappable, each camera-first.

🟦 Action 1 — “Add My Truck & Trailer”

Visual

Camera icon

Photo preview placeholder

Tap Action

Opens camera / photo picker

Routes to:

onboarding/vehicle-capture

Copy

Take a photo. We’ll figure out the rest.

🟩 Action 2 — “Add My Tools”

Visual

Toolbox / drill icon

Tap Action

Opens camera / photo picker

Routes to:

onboarding/tool-capture

Copy

No lists. Just photos.

🟨 Action 3 — “Add a Job From a Sticky Note”

Visual

Sticky note icon

Slight emphasis / glow (this is the WOW path)

Tap Action

Opens camera

Routes to:

onboarding/sticky-note-capture

Copy

Snap a photo. We’ll turn it into a real job.

SECONDARY UI (NON-BLOCKING)

Below the cards:

“Skip for now” (subtle text button)

Allows contractor to explore

Still marked as onboarding_incomplete

Progress hint

“You can do this anytime. Nothing here is permanent.”

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Frontend

New page component:
ContractorOnboardingEntry.tsx

Must:

Detect role + onboarding state

Be responsive (mobile-first)

Support camera APIs

Work inside existing auth/session system

Routing Logic
if (user.role in ['contractor_admin', 'contractor_worker']
    && !user.contractor_onboarding_complete) {
  redirect('/contractor/onboard');
}

State Tracking

Create local onboarding state (frontend only for now):

type ContractorOnboardingState = {
  vehicle_started: boolean;
  tools_started: boolean;
  sticky_note_started: boolean;
};


Persist completion flags later (Prompt A4 / B3 / C4).

MESSAGING INTEGRATION (YES, NOW)

On first visit:

Automatically create a system DM thread:

Participants:

Contractor

Operator (Ellen)

System message:

“Contractor onboarding started.”

This reinforces:

Visibility

Trust

Audit trail

Zero side-channel behavior

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MUST ALL PASS)
Functional

Contractor can reach onboarding without typing anything

All three actions open the camera

Contractor can skip onboarding

No data is committed yet

Experiential

Entire page usable with one hand on a phone

Contractor understands value in <10 seconds

No cognitive load

Architectural

No schema changes beyond onboarding flag

No asset creation yet

No service runs created yet

Clean separation of concerns

OUT OF SCOPE (EXPLICITLY)

AI recognition

Asset creation

Service run creation

OCR

Negotiation

Billing

Those start immediately next.
