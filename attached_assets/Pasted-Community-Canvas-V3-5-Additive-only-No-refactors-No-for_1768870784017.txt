Community Canvas V3.5 — Additive-only. No refactors. No forbidden terminology tokens.

Goal: Complete P-UI-17:
- Admin: Roles & access management
- Admin: Settings
- Folios: dedicated UI for viewing folios/ledger summaries (read-only unless existing mutation endpoints already exist)

STEP 1 — INVENTORY (evidence required)
1) Admin role sources:
- Identify where tenant roles are defined (cc_tenant_users roles)
- Identify where portal roles are defined (cc_portal_members roles)
- Identify any role catalogs/endpoints already created (you just added circle roles list; check for tenant/portal role list)
2) Settings:
- Identify settings tables (tenant_settings, portal_settings, notification_preferences, etc.)
- Identify any existing settings endpoints
3) Folios:
- Identify folio tables (cc_folios, cc_folio_ledger, cc_folio_ledger_links)
- Identify existing API endpoints for folios/ledger (search for /folios, /ledger)
- Identify any existing UI surface that already shows folio summaries (if any)

STEP 2 — NAV / ROLE VISIBILITY
Add an "Admin" section visible only to tenant admin/owner (and platform admin if exists):
- /app/admin/roles
- /app/admin/settings
Add a "Folios" item under Admin or Finance depending on existing nav conventions:
- /app/folios (or /app/admin/folios)

STEP 3 — API (ONLY if missing; do not redesign)
A) Roles management endpoints:
- GET  /api/p2/admin/roles/catalog       (available role types for tenant + portal)
- GET  /api/p2/admin/users              (tenant users + portal members)
- PATCH /api/p2/admin/users/:id          (update role / status)
All must enforce tenant admin/owner permission and portal scoping.

B) Settings endpoints:
- GET  /api/p2/admin/settings/tenant
- PATCH /api/p2/admin/settings/tenant
- GET  /api/p2/admin/settings/portal
- PATCH /api/p2/admin/settings/portal
Only implement fields that already exist in schema (no invented settings).

C) Folios endpoints (read-only minimum):
- GET /api/p2/folios                      (list)
- GET /api/p2/folios/:folioId             (summary)
- GET /api/p2/folios/:folioId/ledger      (ledger lines, paginated)
If these already exist elsewhere, reuse them and do not duplicate.

STEP 4 — UI
A) Admin Roles Page: /app/admin/roles
- Table of users/members
- Filters: role, status
- Edit role dialog (dropdown)
- Clear permission copy: “Tenant role” vs “Portal role”
- data-testid on all interactive elements

B) Admin Settings Page: /app/admin/settings
- Tenant Settings panel + Portal Settings panel (tabs)
- Each setting has label + helper text
- Save button with optimistic UI + error handling
- Do not include settings that are not backed by schema

C) Folios UI:
- Folios list page: searchable, filter by status/date, shows totals
- Folio detail page: header summary + ledger table
- Ledger lines show: timestamp, type, amount, linked entity (reservation/surface/incident) if available
- No mutations unless mutation endpoints already exist and are already used elsewhere

STEP 5 — QA
- Route inventory updated
- Auth tests:
  - non-admin cannot access admin endpoints/pages
  - admin can list users and update roles
- Terminology scan clean

Return:
- files changed
- endpoints created vs reused
- which settings fields were exposed
- folio UI routes created
