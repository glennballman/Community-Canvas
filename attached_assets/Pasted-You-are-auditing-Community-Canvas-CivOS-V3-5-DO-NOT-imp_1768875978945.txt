You are auditing Community Canvas / CivOS V3.5. DO NOT implement anything. Inventory only.

GOAL:
Produce a complete, authoritative inventory of:
1) All features/subsystems implemented in the codebase
2) All major workflows (end-to-end user journeys)
3) All prompts/specs/plan documents since Dec 21 in this repo/workspace
4) A proposed "Final Navigation Map" that exposes all features (single-user mode, no role gating required)

OUTPUT FILES (write all to ./proof/v3.5/):
- feature-inventory.md
- workflow-inventory.md
- prompt-history-inventory.md
- final-navigation-proposal.md
- nav-wiring-targets.md

PART 1 — FEATURE INVENTORY (Repo-truth)
Search and enumerate by subsystem with file paths:
- Public reservation flow (availability → proposal → hold → risk → invite → split pay → confirm)
- Portal operations: Assets, Reservations, Operations Board, Housekeeping, Incidents, Service Runs, Work Requests/Procurement
- Messaging: Conversations, Notifications, Job Application Conversations, mark-read, redaction, contact unlock
- Jobs: Job postings + applications + applicant messaging + operator review surfaces
- Circles: CRUD + members + delegations + messaging linkage (if present)
- Fleet: assets + maintenance + dashboard
- Media: R2 integration + presign/complete + entity binding + upload UI + galleries
- Admin: roles/settings/folios + folio ledger detail
- Platform: tenants + analytics + certification status + system explorer
- Dev surfaces

For each feature:
- UI routes/pages
- API endpoints
- DB tables (if relevant)
- "entry point" (how a human finds it today)

PART 2 — WORKFLOW INVENTORY (End-to-end)
List workflows and their "happy path" steps, with route names:
- Create a reservation (operator/manual if exists) and manage it
- Public reservation conversion loop
- Create a service run, collect signups, open bidding, select contractor
- Create a work request, receive bids, message bidders, attach media, award
- Post a job advertisement, review applicants, message applicant, progress status
- Housekeeping: view tasks, open task detail, upload before/after/issue photos, complete task
- Fleet: view assets, add maintenance record, view upcoming maintenance
- Circles: create circle, add member, delegate, view circle detail
- Messaging/notifications: unread badge, notifications center, mark read

PART 3 — PROMPT HISTORY INVENTORY (Dec 21 → present)
Search workspace for prompts/spec logs:
- ./proof/
- any docs named "prompt", "handoff", "context", "spec", "plan", "build", "status"
- any markdown files in root/docs/ or similar
Produce chronological list (best effort) including:
- filename
- date found (from file name or git history if available)
- short description
If git history is available locally: use `git log --name-only --since="2025-12-21"` to map commits to prompt/spec files.

Write results to prompt-history-inventory.md.

PART 4 — FINAL NAVIGATION PROPOSAL (single-user mode)
Design a final left-nav (App) that exposes everything. Assume Glenn is the only user:
- Show all feature areas
- Minimal gating (only hide Dev if desired)
- Provide clear labels that distinguish:
  - Jobs (hiring) vs Work Requests (contractor bids) vs Service Runs (bundles)
Output as a clean tree with routes.

PART 5 — NAV WIRING TARGETS
Locate the actual sidebar renderer and identify:
- current nav source (legacy arrays vs V3_NAV)
- file paths to change
- minimal patch required to make sidebar consume the final nav config
No implementation, only the exact wiring plan.

DELIVERABLES:
Write the 5 output files listed above into proof/v3.5/.
