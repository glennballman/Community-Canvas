# TASK: Prompt 1 + 2 Completion Verification (MANDATORY) — NO NEW FEATURES

Do NOT implement Prompt 3. Do NOT add improvements.  
Your only job is to TEST and produce the verification report exactly as specified.

## 0) Confirm scope
- Confirm whether Prompt 1 and Prompt 2 are fully complete.
- If any item is incomplete, list it as FAIL with a fix plan (but do not implement fixes yet).

## 1) Files changed (EXPLICIT LIST)
Provide a complete list of every file you created/edited for Prompt 1 + 2, grouped by:
- client/pages
- client/layouts
- client/components
- server/routes (if any)
- migrations (if any)

For each file: 1 sentence on what changed.

## 2) Route-by-route smoke test (PASS/FAIL)
For each route below, perform the test in the running app and report PASS/FAIL with notes + console status.

### Required routes
- /app/service-runs
- /app/service-runs/new
- /app/service-runs/:slug  (legacy run)
- /app/service-runs/:slug  (coop run; slug starts with coop-)
- /app/services
- /app/bundles

### Also verify these do NOT break
- /admin
- /admin/data/accommodations
- /app/dashboard
- /app/availability

For each route include:
- What you clicked (1-3 bullets)
- What loaded (1-2 bullets)
- Any console errors (must be “none”)

## 3) Interaction checklist (must all PASS)
### Service Runs list (/app/service-runs)
- Page loads without crashing
- Uses real API data (or shows correct empty state after a successful API call)
- Filters/search (if present) do not crash
- Clicking a legacy run navigates to detail
- Clicking a coop run navigates to detail

### Create Service Run (/app/service-runs/new)
- Toggle between Bidding vs Co-op works without losing state unexpectedly
- Submitting Bidding Run hits /api/service-runs/runs and returns success or a clear validation error (no crash)
- Submitting Co-op Run hits /api/coop-runs/ and returns success or clear validation error (no crash)

### Service Run Detail (/app/service-runs/:slug)
- Legacy detail loads
- Coop detail loads
- Status displayed, key fields render
- No runtime errors

### Services (/app/services)
- Loads categories/services list
- Search/filter doesn’t crash
- Empty state renders if no services

### Bundles (/app/bundles)
- Loads bundles list
- Seasonal calendar tab renders
- Empty state renders if no bundles

## 4) Navigation verified (PASS/FAIL)
- Community left nav includes: Services, Bundles, Service Runs
- Clicking each nav item routes correctly
- Business nav unchanged
- No duplicate/ghost items

## 5) Prompt 2 hardening proof
For each of the 5 service pages, confirm it has:
- loading state
- empty state
- error state
Describe exactly how you tested each state (mocking network error is acceptable).

## 6) Style compliance check (IMPORTANT)
We required “no redesign.” You mentioned:
- “dedicated coop run view”
- “blue theming”

Answer explicitly:
- Did you change layout or global styles? (Yes/No)
- If yes: list exactly what changed and why it was necessary.
- If it’s only a badge/indicator: confirm it’s limited to a small, local component style.

## 7) FINAL VERDICT
- Prompt 1: COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE
- Prompt 2: COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE
- If complete: state “READY FOR PROMPT 3” (do not start Prompt 3 yet)

BEGIN TESTING NOW AND RETURN THE REPORT.
