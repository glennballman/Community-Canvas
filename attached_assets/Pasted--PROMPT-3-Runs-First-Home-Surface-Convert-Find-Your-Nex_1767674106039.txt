# PROMPT 3: Runs-First Home Surface — Convert “Find Your Next Project” to “Upcoming Service Runs”
# (Use Shared Runs terminology; Work Requests/Work Orders reserved; No redesign)

Do NOT change global layout, navigation structure, or styling system. This is a **surface conversion**: copy + data wiring + labeling.
Keep the same shell, spacing, components, and card layout as much as possible.

## 0) Identify target page (MANDATORY)
Find the component that renders the screen titled “Find Your Next Project” (Glenn screenshot).
In your response, confirm:
- Route path (URL)
- Component file path

Only then proceed.

## 1) Header copy (exact)
Replace:
- Title: “Find Your Next Project”
- Subtitle: “Browse open opportunities across British Columbia's remote communities”
With:
- Title: “Upcoming Service Runs”
- Subtitle: “Shared mobilizations that bring contractors, equipment, and essential services into remote communities.”

## 2) Primary feed becomes Service Runs (default)
The main list/cards must show **Service Runs** (both Bidding Runs and Shared Runs).
- Default view = Service Runs
- Add a secondary tab for “Work Requests” (if the old page was powered by work requests)

Tabs:
- “Service Runs” (default)
- “Work Requests” (secondary)

## 3) Data sources (no mock data)
Service Runs tab:
- Fetch bidding runs from the existing service runs endpoint
- Fetch shared runs from /api/shared-runs
- Merge and sort by soonest date (start date)
- Each card must include:
  - Run title
  - Community (or region)
  - Date window
  - Status
  - Type badge:
    - “Bidding Run” or “Shared Run”
  - Capacity/fill:
    - bidding: signups / max slots (or bids count if that exists)
    - shared: members/jobs count
  - CTA button: “View run” → /app/service-runs/:slug
- Remove budget fields if they don’t map cleanly.

Work Requests tab:
- Keep existing list logic (formerly “opportunities”), but rename visible labels to “Work Requests”
- CTA: “View request”

## 4) Search/filter controls
Keep existing search bar and dropdown controls (no redesign), but update labels.
If filters don’t apply to Service Runs, disable them gracefully with helper text:
- “Filters apply to Work Requests.”

## 5) Empty states (exact tone)
If no service runs:
- Headline: “Nothing scheduled yet.”
- Body: “When the next run is posted, it’ll show up here. Check back soon.”

## 6) Verification report (MANDATORY)
Provide:
- Files edited (list)
- Confirm route + component
- Confirm Service Runs tab is default
- Confirm click path:
  - card → /app/service-runs/:slug → detail loads
- Confirm no console errors

BEGIN.
