BC has an official library dataset with GPS coordinates.

Download the data from: 
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/residents/sports-and-recreation/arts-culture/public-libraries/bc_public_libraries_mailing_addresses_list.xlsx

Or use the BC Data Catalogue CSV:
https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f

The data includes:
- Library name
- Address
- City
- Postal code
- Phone
- Website (some)
- Latitude/Longitude
- Library system name

Create an import script that for each library:

1. Creates an entity with:
   - slug = generate from name (e.g., "library-vancouver-central")
   - name = library name
   - entity_type_id = "library"
   - region_id = match city to geo_regions
   - latitude = from data
   - longitude = from data
   - phone = library phone
   - website = library website (if available)
   - address_line1 = street address
   - city = city name
   - postal_code = postal code
   - metadata = JSON with:
     - library_system = parent system name (e.g., "Vancouver Public Library")
     - branch_type = "branch" or "main"

-- Distribution by system
SELECT 
  metadata->>'library_system' as system,

GROUP BY metadata->>'library_system'
ORDER BY branches DESC
LIMIT 10;
