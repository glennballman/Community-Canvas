PROMPT C — FIX OPERATIONS BOARD RESOURCES + BOOKING SEMANTICS SMOKE TEST (NO POSTGIS)

Context / Evidence:
- /admin/inventory (Platform Admin) shows Ballman Enterprises has unified_assets like “F550 Truck” and “Lucky Lander”.
- When impersonating Ballman Enterprises and going to /app/operations, it shows “No resources found”.
- Operations Board loads resources via GET /api/schedule/resources and events via GET /api/schedule.
- unified_assets is canonical. The tenant ownership field is owner_tenant_id (not tenant_id).
Goal:
- Operations Board must show resources for the impersonated tenant.
- Bookings and schedule blocks must render on the 15-minute grid.
- Booking UI must display semantic labels (Checking in/out, Arriving/Departing, Pickup/Return) and presets (Half-day, Full-day, Overnight) while still storing starts_at/ends_at at 15-min resolution.

TASK 1 — Diagnose + fix “No resources found” in Operations Board
1) Open server/routes/schedule.ts (or wherever /api/schedule/resources is implemented).
2) Verify tenant scoping:
   - Ensure tenant id is derived from the authenticated context used everywhere else (same pattern as admin inventory + impersonation).
   - Fix any mismatch between req.user.tenant_id vs req.user.tenantId vs req.tenant.id, etc.
3) Fix the query for resources:
   - It MUST filter unified_assets by owner_tenant_id = currentTenantId (NOT tenant_id).
   - Also ensure soft-state filters don’t hide everything:
     - If operational_status exists, include active by default but allow viewing all via query param later.
     - Do not require bookings to exist.
4) Add server logging (temporary, dev only) for:
   - resolved tenant id
   - resource count returned
   Remove/guard logs after confirmation.

TASK 2 — Confirm schedule overlay logic uses the same “resource_id” key
1) Validate resource_schedule_events.resource_id references unified_assets.id.
2) Validate unified_bookings.asset_id references unified_assets.id.
3) In GET /api/schedule:
   - return merged blocks with a consistent shape:
     { id, source: 'schedule'|'booking', resource_id, event_type, starts_at, ends_at, title, notes }
   - bookings should appear as event_type = 'booked'.

TASK 3 — UI: make Operations Board show assets immediately
1) In client/src/pages/app/OperationsBoard.tsx (or similar):
   - Confirm it calls /api/schedule/resources and renders rows from that response.
2) If rows are empty, show a helpful message that includes tenant name + a link button to Inventory:
   “No inventory found for this business yet. Add inventory to schedule it.”
   But after TASK 1 fix, it should NOT be empty for Ballman.

TASK 4 — Booking semantics smoke test: surface it where it actually exists
Right now I can’t “see” the semantic labels layer you implemented. Do this:
1) Find the UI component that renders booking start/end labels (you referenced RentalBrowser.tsx previously).
2) Ensure it is used in at least one visible flow from the left nav:
   - Inventory → select an asset → “Book” (or “Create Booking”) opens a booking modal.
3) Booking modal requirements:
   - Shows two datetime pickers snapped to 15-min increments.
   - Label the pickers based on asset type:
     - accommodation/property/room: “Checking in” / “Checking out”
     - vehicle/watercraft/transport: “Arriving” / “Departing”
     - equipment/rental: “Pickup” / “Return”
     - fallback: “Start” / “End”
   - Preset buttons:
     - Half-day = +4 hours (snapped)
     - Full-day = +8 hours (snapped)
     - Overnight = +24 hours (snapped)
   - On save: create unified_booking (status confirmed/pending is fine) and route back to Bookings + reflect immediately on Operations Board as a booked block.

TASK 5 — Seed data (only if needed to visually confirm)
If Ballman has assets but zero bookings/events, create a small dev-only seed (or use SQL insert in a migration-safe way) that adds:
- One unified_booking for Lucky Lander (arrive 10:15, depart 12:45)
- One resource_schedule_event maintenance block for Lucky Lander child “Crane” (blocked for maintenance)
- One buffer block for F550 (15–30 min)
This is purely to confirm the grid renders. Do NOT rely on PostGIS.

Acceptance Criteria (must verify in UI):
- Impersonate Ballman Enterprises → /app/operations shows resource rows (at least F550 + Lucky Lander).
- Add Block works and snaps to 15-minute grid.
- Create Booking from Inventory uses semantic labels and presets.
- Booking appears in Bookings list AND as “booked” block on Operations Board.
- No console errors.

After completion, reply with:
- Files changed
- Exact bug cause (tenant_id vs owner_tenant_id or auth context mismatch)
- Screens/steps to reproduce before/after
