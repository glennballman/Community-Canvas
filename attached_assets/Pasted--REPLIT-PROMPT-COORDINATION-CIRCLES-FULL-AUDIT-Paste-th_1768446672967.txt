✅ REPLIT PROMPT — COORDINATION CIRCLES FULL AUDIT

Paste this verbatim into Replit:

You are performing a forensic audit of the existing implementation related to Coordination Circles in the Community Canvas V3 system.

Your task is to find, enumerate, and explain everything that already exists, not to propose new features.

1. DATA MODEL & SCHEMA

List all database tables related to Coordination Circles, including:

coordination circles / groups / hubs

memberships

roles, scopes, or contexts

any polymorphic or generic “group” constructs used to represent them

For each table:

table name

purpose

key columns

how it relates to tenants, communities, or users

2. AUTHORITY & PERMISSIONS

Identify how Coordination Circles are allowed to initiate actions

Show:

permission checks

role or scope logic

any “acting as” or context-switching mechanisms

Explicitly answer:

How does the system know an action was taken as a Coordination Circle?

How attribution is stored and audited

3. MESSAGING & INBOUND ROUTING

Identify all messaging, inbox, or communication systems that support:

inbound calls / messages

routing to Coordination Circles

switching hats between Circle / Tenant / Individual

Include:

message tables

routing logic

UI entry points if they exist

4. INVENTORY & SCHEDULING SURFACES

Identify how Coordination Circles currently:

view inventory

view or manage calendars

see cross-tenant availability

Note whether this is:

first-class

inherited from tenant views

partially implemented

5. UI & ROUTES (IF ANY)

List any existing:

routes

pages

components

nav entries
that reference or imply Coordination Circles

If none exist, say so explicitly

6. API / EDGE FUNCTIONS

List any API routes or edge functions that:

reference coordination

operate on behalf of groups

accept a context parameter

7. WHAT IS COMPLETE vs PARTIAL

Categorize findings into:

✅ implemented and usable

⚠️ partially implemented

❌ planned but not built

8. CONSTRAINTS & ASSUMPTIONS

Identify any hard-coded assumptions that might block:

multi-circle membership

cross-tenant coordination

non-admin actors initiating actions

Important rules:

Do NOT propose improvements

Do NOT design UI

Do NOT refactor

Only report what exists and where

Quote file paths, table names, and functions explicitly

Output the audit in a structured report.
