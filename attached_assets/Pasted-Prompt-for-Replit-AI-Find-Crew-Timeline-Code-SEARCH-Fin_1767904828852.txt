Prompt for Replit AI - Find Crew Timeline Code
**SEARCH: Find the Crew Service Run Timeline / Journey Planning Code**

We previously built a feature that displayed a complete timeline view for a crew traveling from Surrey to Bamfield to install windows. This included:

- Driving route with time estimates
- BC Ferries schedules and real-time capacity
- DriveBC road conditions and webcams
- Tide tables
- Water taxi schedules
- Bamfield Marine Science Centre webcams
- Real-time status updates

**Task: Find all related code**

1. **Search for keywords in the codebase:**
```bash
# Search for timeline/journey related files
grep -rn "timeline\|journey\|service.run\|crew\|bamfield\|ferry\|drivebc" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" server/ client/ shared/ | grep -v node_modules | head -100

# Search for BC Ferries integration
grep -rn "bcferries\|bc.ferries\|ferry.capacity\|sailing" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" server/ client/ shared/ | grep -v node_modules

# Search for DriveBC integration  
grep -rn "drivebc\|drive.bc\|road.condition\|webcam\|highway" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" server/ client/ shared/ | grep -v node_modules

# Search for real-time feeds
grep -rn "realtime\|real.time\|live.feed\|weather.station\|tide" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" server/ client/ shared/ | grep -v node_modules
```

2. **Check for service run related tables:**
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND (tablename LIKE '%service%' 
       OR tablename LIKE '%crew%' 
       OR tablename LIKE '%journey%'
       OR tablename LIKE '%timeline%'
       OR tablename LIKE '%ferry%'
       OR tablename LIKE '%road%');
```

3. **Check for API routes related to:**
- Service runs
- Crew scheduling
- Journey planning
- BC Ferries
- DriveBC
- Real-time feeds

Look in:
- `server/routes/` for any files mentioning service runs, crews, ferries, roads
- `client/src/pages/` for timeline or journey views
- `shared/` for any feed integration types

4. **List all files that might be relevant:**
```bash
find . -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l "ferry\|drivebc\|timeline\|journey\|crew\|service.run" 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules
```

**Report back:**
- All files found related to this feature
- Key functions/components that render timelines
- API endpoints that fetch real-time data
- Database tables that store journey/service run data
- Any feed integration code (BC Ferries, DriveBC, weather, tides, webcams)

Show me the file paths and a brief description of what each contains.
