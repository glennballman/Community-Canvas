I need you to run diagnostic queries and report the output WITHOUT making any changes. Do not fix anything - just report what you find.

=== DIAGNOSTIC 1: Database Table Check ===

Run this SQL query in the database and show me the complete output:
```sql
-- Check road_trips data
SELECT id, title, region, 
       cost_budget, cost_moderate, cost_comfort,
       rating, rating_count
FROM road_trips 
ORDER BY id;
```

=== DIAGNOSTIC 2: Segment Cost Verification ===

Run this SQL and show output:
```sql
-- Compare trip totals vs segment totals
SELECT 
  t.id,
  t.title,
  t.cost_moderate as "Trip Cost (Moderate)",
  COALESCE(SUM(s.cost_moderate), 0) as "Segment Total",
  t.cost_moderate - COALESCE(SUM(s.cost_moderate), 0) as "Difference"
FROM road_trips t
LEFT JOIN trip_segments s ON t.id = s.trip_id
GROUP BY t.id, t.title, t.cost_moderate
ORDER BY t.id;
```

=== DIAGNOSTIC 3: Segment Details ===

Run this SQL and show output:
```sql
-- Show all segments with their costs and types
SELECT 
  trip_id,
  segment_order,
  title,
  segment_type,
  cost_budget,
  cost_moderate, 
  cost_comfort,
  details->>'mode' as transport_mode,
  details->>'activity_type' as activity_type,
  array_length(webcam_ids, 1) as webcam_count
FROM trip_segments
ORDER BY trip_id, segment_order;
```

=== DIAGNOSTIC 4: Ferry Segment Check ===

Run this SQL and show output:
```sql
-- Find all ferry segments
SELECT 
  trip_id,
  title,
  cost_moderate,
  details->>'mode' as mode,
  details->>'operator' as operator,
  details->>'fare' as fare
FROM trip_segments
WHERE details->>'mode' = 'ferry';
```

=== DIAGNOSTIC 5: Webcam Entity Sample ===

Run this SQL and show output:
```sql
-- Sample webcam entities to understand structure
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  slug,
  SUBSTRING(metadata->>'direct_feed_url', 1, 80) as feed_url_preview,
  SUBSTRING(metadata->>'image_url', 1, 80) as image_url_preview
FROM entities 
WHERE entity_type_id = 'webcam'
LIMIT 15;
```

=== DIAGNOSTIC 6: API Response Check ===

Run these curl commands and show me the JSON output:
```bash
echo "=== Trip List ==="
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/v1/trips | head -100

echo ""
echo "=== Whistler Trip Detail ==="
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/v1/trips/whistler-ski-day | head -150

echo ""
echo "=== Whistler Conditions ==="
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/v1/trips/whistler-ski-day/conditions

echo ""
echo "=== Whistler Webcams ==="
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/v1/trips/whistler-ski-day/webcams | head -100

echo ""
echo "=== Tofino Conditions ==="
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/v1/trips/tofino-storm-watching/conditions

echo ""
echo "=== Sunshine Coast Conditions ==="
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/v1/trips/sunshine-coast-loop/conditions
```

=== DIAGNOSTIC 7: Frontend Component Check ===

Search and show me the current code for these specific items:

1. In JourneyView.tsx, find and show me:
   - The WebcamThumbnail component (how it gets the image URL)
   - The conditions display section (how it shows weather/ferry/alerts)
   - How the budget breakdown calculates the total

2. In the trips API route, show me:
   - The /conditions endpoint (full code)
   - The /webcams endpoint (full code)
