You are working in Community Canvas (Replit dev). Do NOT redesign anything. Do NOT add new features. This is wiring + refactor only.

GOAL:
Bookings “Calendar View” must use the exact same scheduling surface as the Operations Board: resources down the left and time across the top. The current Bookings calendar grid (time down the left, dates across the top) must be removed completely.

TASKS:

1) DELETE THE NEW BOOKINGS CALENDAR
- Find the Bookings calendar implementation (likely in client/src/pages/app/business/BookingsPage.tsx or similar).
- Remove the weekly grid that shows times down the left and dates across the top.
- The Bookings “Calendar View” should no longer render any bespoke calendar layout.

2) EXTRACT/REUSE OPERATIONS BOARD SCHEDULER AS CANONICAL
- Identify the component(s) Operations Board uses to render:
  - the resources list (Vehicles/Watercraft)
  - the timeline grid
  - blocks on the grid
  - the zoom controls (15 min / 1 hour / Day)
- Extract these into a shared component:
  - src/components/schedule/ScheduleBoard.tsx (or similar)
- Operations Board should use this shared component after extraction (no behavior change).
- Bookings Calendar View should use this same shared component.

3) EXPAND ZOOM LEVELS
- The zoom control must include: 15 min, 1 hour, Day, Week, Month, Season, Year.
- Implement zoom as a single enum/string union used by ScheduleBoard.
- For each zoom level, define:
  - visible date range (start/end)
  - time resolution (cell size)
Suggested mapping:
  - 15 min: 24h day view with 15-min columns
  - 1 hour: 24h day view with hourly columns
  - Day: single day view (could match 1 hour or a coarser scale, but keep existing semantics)
  - Week: 7-day view with day columns (like Ops “Day/Week toggle” style)
  - Month: month range with day columns
  - Season: 3-month range with week columns (or day columns if already easy)
  - Year: 12-month range with month columns
Keep it deterministic and stable; accuracy > fancy UI.

4) BOOKINGS RENDER AS BLOCKS ON THE SCHEDULE BOARD
- In Bookings calendar mode:
  - resources = inventory assets (same grouping as Ops)
  - blocks = bookings mapped into ScheduleBoard’s block type:
    - resource_id = booking.asset_id (or equivalent)
    - start/end = booking start/end timestamps
    - label = customer or booking title
    - status controls block style (confirmed/pending/completed)
- Reuse existing bookings query; do not create new endpoints.

5) KEEP BOOKING CREATION WIRED AS-IS
- Do not redesign booking creation.
- If there is a “New Booking” button (top right), it stays.
- The calendar surface should not introduce new UX beyond clicking to select time (only if already implemented).
Focus is: view consistency + showing bookings on the canonical scheduler.

6) PROOF REQUIREMENT
- After implementation provide:
  - list of files changed
  - what you deleted
  - screenshots:
    - Bookings Calendar View showing resources on left + time across top
    - Operations Board still working
  - confirm zoom buttons show: 15 min, 1 hour, Day, Week, Month, Season, Year

IMPORTANT:
- No route renames.
- No UI redesign.
- Prefer extracting Ops components rather than rewriting them.
