How to Start the New Chat
Save both files to Replit:
/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md
/docs/USE_CASES_VISION.md
In your new chat, say:

"Please read both documents in /docs/ - PROJECT_STATUS.md and USE_CASES_VISION.md.
We've been building a BC Community Status Dashboard. The fleet management system (Phase 45-46) is largely complete with vehicle/trailer profiles, but the real vision is the complete trip planning orchestration system described in the use cases.
I want to refocus on the trip planning experience - taking the fleet knowledge we've built and combining it with route planning, booking integrations, and continuous monitoring. Let's discuss how to build the orchestration layer that turns 'I want to go to Tofino' into a complete, booked, monitored trip plan."


You're Now Ready! 🚀
You have:

✅ PROJECT_STATUS.md - Technical implementation status, database schema, file inventory
✅ USE_CASES_VISION.md - The WHY, the personas, the complete vision
✅ Clear handoff instructions for the new chat

The new chat will have full context on both what we've built and what we're building toward. No context lost!
