I need you to perform a complete architecture audit of this project to diagnose data consistency issues. The symptom is: you tell me data has been updated, but I don't see the changes in the dashboard.

Please provide a detailed report answering ALL of the following. Be thorough and show actual file paths, code snippets, and query results.

## SECTION 1: DATA STORAGE AUDIT

1.1 List ALL files that contain chamber member data:
- Run: find . -name "*.json" -exec grep -l -i "member\|chamber" {} \;
- Run: find . -name "*.js" -exec grep -l "members.*=.*\[" {} \;
- Show me the file paths and a sample of what's in each

1.2 Show the database schema for chamber-related tables:
- Run the SQL: \dt *member* or SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name LIKE '%member%';
- Show me the CREATE TABLE statements or column definitions
- Show current row counts: SELECT 'chamber_members' as tbl, COUNT(*) FROM chamber_members UNION ALL... (for each relevant table)

1.3 For Sooke specifically, show me:
- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [whatever table] WHERE [chamber = 'Sooke' or similar];
- SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [chamber = 'Sooke'] LIMIT 5;
- Are there JSON files with Sooke data? Show contents.

## SECTION 2: DATA FLOW TRACE

2.1 When Firecrawl scrapes a chamber website, what happens to the data?
- Show me the code path from scrape completion to database insert
- What function/file handles this?
- Is there intermediate storage (temp files, staging tables)?

2.2 Show me the API endpoints related to chambers/members:
- List all routes in your API (grep for app.get, app.post, router.get, etc.)
- Show me the specific endpoint that the dashboard calls to get member data
- Show the actual code for that endpoint

2.3 How does the React frontend load chamber data?
- Find the component that displays member counts
- Show me the fetch/import statement - does it call an API or import a JSON file directly?
- Show the actual code

## SECTION 3: CACHING & BUILD ANALYSIS

3.1 Is there any caching?
- Search for: grep -r "cache" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"
- Search for: grep -r "Cache-Control" --include="*.js"
- Any Redis, memory cache, or memoization?

3.2 Check for build-time data bundling:
- Look at vite.config.js, webpack.config.js, next.config.js, or similar
- Are JSON files being imported/required in a way that bundles them?
- Show any dynamic imports of data files

3.3 Show me package.json scripts:
- What does "npm run build" or the build command do?
- Is there a prebuild step that processes data?

## SECTION 4: DISCREPANCY DIAGNOSIS

4.1 Right now, tell me what EACH source says about Sooke member count:
- Database query result: SELECT COUNT(*)...
- JSON file (if exists): wc -l or parse and count
- API endpoint response: curl localhost:PORT/api/chambers/sooke or similar
- What the React component would receive

4.2 Are these numbers the same or different? If different, explain why.

## SECTION 5: RECENT CHANGES

5.1 Show me the last 10 file modifications related to chambers/members:
- git log --oneline -20 --all -- "*member*" "*chamber*" "*.json"
- Or: ls -lt | head -20 for recently modified files

5.2 What did you (Replit AI) modify when I asked you to fix Sooke to 85 members?
- What file(s) did you edit?
- What was the before/after?

## FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:

### Section 1.1: Data Files Found
[your findings with file paths]

### Section 1.2: Database Schema
[schema output]

...and so on for each section.

Be completely honest. If you find that JSON files are being used when they shouldn't be, or if the architecture has problems, tell me. I need the truth to fix this.
