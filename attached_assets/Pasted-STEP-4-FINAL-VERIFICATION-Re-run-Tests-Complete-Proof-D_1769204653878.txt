STEP 4 FINAL VERIFICATION — Re-run Tests + Complete Proof Document

You said STEP 4 is complete, but tests were skipped due to auth confusion. 
Now re-run verification using the CORRECT test auth system.

## A) RE-RUN TESTS WITH TEST AUTH BOOTSTRAP

Use the test auth helper for all testing:
```typescript
import { loginAs } from './helpers/testAuth';

// Login as Ellen (service provider)
await loginAs(page, 'ellen');

// Then navigate to provider runs
await page.goto('/app/provider/runs');
```

Verify these acceptance criteria:

1. [ ] GET /api/provider/runs returns { ok: true, runs: [...] } for authenticated provider
2. [ ] GET /api/provider/runs/:id returns { ok: true, run: {...}, attached_requests: [...], publications: [...] }
3. [ ] /app/provider/runs page renders list (may be empty, that's OK)
4. [ ] /app/provider/runs/:id page renders detail (test with a real run ID if any exist)
5. [ ] Navigation shows "My Runs" or "Service Runs" in provider section
6. [ ] No UI login required — test auth bootstrap works

## B) COMPLETE PROOF DOCUMENT

Create or update: proof/v3.5/service-runs-management-proof.md

MUST INCLUDE:

### 1. DB Evidence
- Confirm cc_n3_runs table exists
- List key columns found
- Document attachment linkage pattern: 
  - Found: [describe pattern] OR
  - "NO ATTACHMENT LINKAGE FOUND — returning empty array"

### 2. Backend Route Evidence
- File path: server/routes/provider.ts (or wherever added)
- Excerpt showing:
  - requireAuth() usage
  - resolveActorParty() or equivalent
  - party_id ownership check
  - Route definitions for GET /api/provider/runs and GET /api/provider/runs/:id

### 3. Frontend Page Evidence
- File paths for:
  - ProviderRunsPage.tsx (list)
  - ProviderRunDetailPage.tsx (detail)
- Excerpt showing:
  - Read-only rendering (no inline edit/delete)
  - MarketMode gating for CTAs (stub buttons)
  - Link-out messaging pattern (not embedded thread)

### 4. Nav Wiring Evidence
- File path of nav config modified
- Excerpt showing new "My Runs" / "Service Runs" entry
- Placement: after Inbox, before Settings

### 5. Copy Token Evidence
- File path where tokens added
- List of tokens added (e.g., provider.runs.title, provider.runs.empty_state, etc.)

### 6. Verification Statements
Include these explicit statements:
- [ ] "No new 'calendar' term introduced in any new code"
- [ ] "No attachment linkage created — read-only detection only"
- [ ] "All CTAs are MarketMode-gated or stubbed"
- [ ] "Test auth bootstrap used for verification (no UI login)"

### 7. Test Results
Paste output or summary of test run showing:
- Auth succeeded via test bootstrap
- Provider runs list rendered
- Provider run detail rendered (or "no runs exist yet" if empty)

## C) OUTPUT

1. Paste the key excerpts from the proof document here
2. Confirm all 6 verification statements are true
3. Confirm tests passed with test auth bootstrap

DO NOT skip tests again. Use loginAs(page, 'ellen') from tests/helpers/testAuth.ts.
