Exact Fixes to Reach 100%
1. Recreate Views (Critical)
Run these in your DB (adjust column names based on actual view definitions):
SQL-- 1. Drop old views (CASCADE if dependencies)
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_unified_accommodations CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_unified_parking CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_unified_self_contained CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_unified_towables CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_pending_notifications CASCADE;

-- 2. Recreate with new names (example - adjust SELECT columns)
CREATE VIEW v_unified_accommodations AS
SELECT
  id,
  portal_id,
  name,
  status,                     -- was booking_status
  reference_code,             -- was booking_reference
  -- ... other columns ...
FROM cc_accommodation_reservations;

CREATE VIEW v_pending_notifications AS
SELECT
  id,
  reservation_id,             -- was booking_id or similar
  status,
  -- ... other columns ...
FROM cc_reservation_notifications
WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Repeat for other views
Evidence Check:
SQLSELECT viewname FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND viewname ILIKE '%unified%' OR viewname ILIKE '%pending%';
-- Should show new views with correct column names
2. Bulk Search/Replace for Cosmetic References
Run this in VS Code or terminal (adjust path):
Bash# Find remaining "booking" (case-insensitive)
grep -ir "booking" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.md" --include="*.json" . | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .next

# Bulk replace in code (careful - review diffs!)
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "*.json" \) -not -path "./node_modules/*" -not -path "./.next/*" \
  -exec sed -i '' 's/booking/reservation/gi' {} \;

# Then manually review UI strings (e.g., "Your booking is confirmed" → "Your reservation is confirmed")
# Common places: components/Confirmation.tsx, emails/templates, etc.
After:
Bashgrep -ir "booking" . | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .next
# Should return 0 (except maybe is_booked or comments you want to keep)
