I need a RUTHLESS proof bundle for Migration 028. No summaries. Provide raw SQL + outputs.

Deliverables:
A) PostGIS zero-proof (hard evidence)
1) SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname ILIKE '%postgis%';
2) Find PostGIS types:
   - search for columns with udt_name in ('geometry','geography') across all schemas
3) Find PostGIS functions/operators:
   - grep in DB: pg_proc + pg_get_functiondef for 'ST_' and 'geometry'/'geography'
4) Find PostGIS references in views:
   - pg_views.definition search for 'ST_'/'geometry'/'geography'

B) Canonical geo correctness proof
1) Show the exact SQL definitions (pg_get_functiondef) for:
   - resolve_community()
   - find_community_by_location()
   - search_unified_assets()
   - find_assets_by_capability()
2) For each, explicitly confirm (by showing the function body) that it uses:
   - bbox or grid prefilter (lat_cell/lon_cell OR lat/lng bounding box)
   - haversine (or equivalent spherical) distance
   - ORDER BY computed distance
Hard FAIL if any function uses sqrt((lat-lat2)^2 + (lng-lng2)^2) or “degree euclidean”.

C) Index + query plan proof (performance)
1) List all lat_cell/lon_cell columns created + table names (pg_attribute query).
2) List indexes that support near-me queries:
   - show index DDL (pg_indexes) for each spatial table
3) Provide EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) for a representative near-me query on:
   - unified assets / searchable_assets
   - external_records / entities (whichever supports location search)
The plan must show index usage (Bitmap/Index Scan) using grid or bbox predicates.
Hard FAIL if sequential scan occurs on tables > 10k rows for near-me.

D) View dependency + row parity proof
1) Show view definitions for:
   - v_unified_accommodations, v_unified_parking, v_unified_towables, v_unified_self_contained, searchable_assets
2) Confirm counts match expected source tables (provide before/after counts).
3) Confirm views contain NO geom/geography types or ST_* calls.

E) Migration hygiene
1) Confirm migrations 018–022 are unchanged from before rollback.
2) Show the diff summary of 028 only.

Output format:
- A single “028_PROOF_BUNDLE.md” file containing SQL blocks and their terminal outputs.
- If ANY check fails, stop and label it FAIL with the first failing query and why.
