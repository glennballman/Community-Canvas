PROMPT 1 — SYSTEM EXPLORER EVIDENCE LOCK
STOP. DO NOT BUILD ANY NEW FEATURES.

You are working in Community Canvas.

Your ONLY task is to harden System Explorer as the permanent,
authoritative source of truth for what exists in the platform.

This is PLATFORM ADMIN infrastructure, not tenant functionality.

────────────────────────────────
NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────────

A) PLACEMENT & VISIBILITY
1. System Explorer route must be:
   /admin/system-explorer
2. It must appear ONLY in PLATFORM_ADMIN_NAV.
3. It must be completely hidden from:
   - BUSINESS_NAV
   - COMMUNITY_NAV
4. When impersonating a tenant:
   - System Explorer must NOT appear in nav
   - Direct access to /admin/system-explorer must be blocked
     with a clear message:
     “Exit impersonation to access System Explorer.”

B) NO BROKEN LINKS — EVER
1. Remove ALL links from System Explorer that navigate to /app/*
2. System Explorer must NEVER redirect to tenant routes.
3. All exploration must remain inside System Explorer.

C) DATA BROWSER MUST WORK (THIS IS THE CORE)
1. “Inspect Data” must open the Data Browser tab.
2. Data Browser must:
   - Render rows if data exists
   - Render an explicit empty state if zero rows
   - Show column names even when empty
3. If a table requires tenant context:
   - Provide a tenant selector
   - Default to a sensible tenant (or “All tenants” if safe)

D) DATA SOURCES MUST BE TRUTHFUL
1. Data Sources tab must show:
   - Actual backing table(s)
   - Real record counts
   - Last updated timestamps
2. If a source has no table:
   - Status = NOT WIRED
   - Reason must be shown
3. “Inspect Snapshots” must open Data Browser
   filtered to the correct table.

E) EVIDENCE RULE (MANDATORY)
You may NOT claim “fixed” unless you provide:

1. Screenshot:
   - Platform Admin nav WITH System Explorer
2. Screenshot:
   - Tenant nav (while impersonating) WITHOUT System Explorer
3. Screenshot:
   - Attempt to access /admin/system-explorer while impersonating
     showing the block message
4. Screenshot:
   - Data Browser showing rows for at least TWO different tables
5. Screenshot:
   - Data Browser showing a valid empty state for one table

F) REGRESSION LOCK
Update QA to assert:
- System Explorer exists in PLATFORM_ADMIN_NAV
- System Explorer does NOT exist in tenant navs
- /admin/system-explorer renders for platform admin
- /admin/system-explorer is blocked during impersonation

If ANY requirement cannot be met:
Say “NOT FIXED” and explain exactly why.

Do NOT touch anything else.
Begin.
