PROMPT 3: Update Bamfield Road Info (No Longer Gravel)
TASK: Update Bamfield Road Information - It's Now Paved

PROBLEM:
The timeline shows "ACTIVE LOGGING ROAD - 90km gravel" but Bamfield Road 
was chip-sealed in October 2023 and is now a paved highway.

SOLUTION:
Update all Bamfield Road references to reflect current conditions.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Update `sampleBamfieldTrip.ts` - find the Bamfield Road event and change:

   FROM:
```typescript
   {
     id: 'drive-bamfield-road',
     type: 'drive_segment',
     title: 'Bamfield Road',
     subtitle: '⚠️ ACTIVE LOGGING ROAD - 90km gravel',
     description: 'Radio required. Active logging trucks Mon-Fri...',
     alerts: [
       {
         severity: 'major',
         title: 'Active Logging Road',
         description: 'Industrial traffic active...',
       },
       {
         severity: 'minor', 
         title: 'Road Condition: Good Gravel',
         description: 'Recently graded. Some potholes...',
       }
     ],
   }
```

   TO:
```typescript
   {
     id: 'drive-bamfield-road',
     type: 'drive_segment',
     time: '2025-01-07T12:15:00',
     title: 'Bamfield Road',
     subtitle: 'Scenic paved highway - 90km',
     description: 'Chip-sealed highway since October 2023. Watch for wildlife, especially deer at dawn/dusk. Some sections have steep grades and sharp curves.',
     location: {
       name: 'Bamfield Road (Highway 4 Extension)',
     },
     photos: [
       {
         url: '/roads/bamfield-road-paved.jpg',
         caption: 'Bamfield Road - Now paved',
         source: 'archive',
       }
     ],
     alerts: [
       {
         severity: 'info',
         title: 'Scenic Route',
         description: 'Winding road with beautiful views. Take your time and watch for wildlife.',
         source: 'System',
       }
     ],
     weather: {
       temperature: 6,
       condition: 'Rain',
       icon: 'rain',
       precipitation: 8,
     },
     duration: 120, // Reduced from 150 - paved road is faster
     distance: 90,
     cost: 15,
   }
```

2. Add a note about the BACKUP route being gravel:
   
   Add a new field or info banner:
```typescript
   {
     // After the Bamfield Road event, add route info
     routeAlternative: {
       name: 'Plan B: Duncan-Youbou Route',
       description: 'Alternative route via Duncan → Lake Cowichan → Youbou → Bamfield. Note: Road is GRAVEL after Youbou. Add 45+ minutes. Use if Highway 4 is closed.',
       isGravel: true,
       additionalTime: 45, // minutes
     }
   }
```

3. Update any hardcoded references in the codebase:
   - Search for "gravel" in trip-related files
   - Search for "logging road" 
   - Update all to reflect current conditions

4. Update the "No fuel in Bamfield" alert to be accurate:
   - Keep the fuel warning (still valid)
   - Remove any references to "gravel road" in the description

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Bamfield Road shows as "Scenic paved highway - 90km"
- No more "ACTIVE LOGGING ROAD" warnings
- Duration reduced from 2h30m to 2h (paved is faster)
- Backup route via Youbou clearly marked as gravel
