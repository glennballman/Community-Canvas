You are working inside the Community Canvas codebase (authoritative branch: main).
This task is UX COPY NORMALIZATION ONLY. Do NOT change schema, APIs, routes, file names, component names, or data models.

GOAL:
Normalize ALL user-facing UI copy in the messaging system from “Conversations”/“Conversation” → “Messages”/“Message”.

IMPORTANT RULE (LOCK THIS IN):
- “Conversation” is an internal container concept (OK in code/schema).
- “Messages” is the user-facing term (must be used in UI).

SCOPE:
1) Frontend UI strings only (React).
2) Update ALL user-visible text in:
   - Messages page headers
   - Left pane titles
   - Empty states
   - Dropdown filters
   - Buttons / menu items (if any)
   - Helper/placeholder text (e.g. “Select a conversation…”)
   - Any toast/alert copy related to messaging

DO NOT:
- rename DB tables cc_conversations / cc_messages
- rename API endpoints
- rename TypeScript types/interfaces
- refactor logic
- change navigation (nav already correctly says “Messages”)

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
A) Search the client codebase for these exact strings (case-insensitive):
   - "Conversations"
   - "Conversation"
   - "Select a conversation"
   - "No conversations yet"
   - "All Conversations"
   - "New Conversation"
   - "Start a conversation"
   - "conversation" (only replace when it is user-facing UI text)

B) Replace with user-facing equivalents:
   - "Conversations" -> "Messages"
   - "Conversation" -> "Message" OR "Thread" ONLY if it truly refers to the container (prefer “Message” for simplicity)
   - "Select a conversation to get started" -> "Select a message to get started"
   - "No conversations yet" -> "No messages yet"
   - "All Conversations" -> "All Messages"
   - "New Conversation" -> "New Message"
   - "Start a conversation" -> "Start a message"

C) Be careful with developer-only or internal identifiers:
   - Do NOT change variable names like conversationId, conversation, conversations in logic.
   - Only change literal strings rendered to the UI.

D) Add a tiny guard against regression:
   - Create a short checklist doc: docs/ui/MESSAGING_TERMINOLOGY.md
     Include:
     - “UI must say Messages”
     - “Schema/internal may say Conversations”
     - examples of correct copy

DELIVERABLES:
1) A PR/commit that updates UI copy across messaging surfaces so the UI never displays “Conversations”.
2) docs/ui/MESSAGING_TERMINOLOGY.md added.
3) Quick manual QA note in the PR description:
   - Visit /app/messages
   - Verify left panel header says “Messages”
   - Verify filter says “All Messages”
   - Verify empty state says “No messages yet”
   - Verify right panel placeholder says “Select a message to get started”

Proceed with minimal changes consistent with current UI patterns.
