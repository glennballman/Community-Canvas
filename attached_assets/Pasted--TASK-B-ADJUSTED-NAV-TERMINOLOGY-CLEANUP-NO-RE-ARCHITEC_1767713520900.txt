# TASK B (ADJUSTED): NAV + TERMINOLOGY CLEANUP (NO RE-ARCHITECTURE)

Do NOT add new features. This is terminology + navigation alignment only.

## B1) ADD MISSING NAV ITEMS (routes already exist)
Add sidebar links for:
- Work Requests -> /app/intake/work-requests
- Projects -> /app/projects

Add them to BOTH:
- COMMUNITY_NAV
- BUSINESS_NAV
in client/src/layouts/TenantAppLayout.tsx

Place them near CRM links.

## B2) TERMINOLOGY (UI LABELS ONLY — DO NOT RENAME ROUTES IN THIS PASS)

Decisions:
- Keep "Places" as the UI word (do NOT rename to Properties)
- Rename "Catalog" to "Inventory" (UI word)
- Use "Contacts" instead of Customers/People where possible

Change nav labels and page headers to:
- "Catalog" -> "Inventory" (label only)
- "Customers" -> "Contacts" (label only)
- "People" -> "Contacts" (label only)
- Keep "Places" as "Places"
- "Organizations" stays "Organizations"

IMPORTANT:
- Keep routes as-is for now:
  /app/catalog stays (but displays "Inventory")
  /app/customers stays (but displays "Contacts")
  /app/crm/people stays (but displays "Contacts")
  /app/crm/places stays (still displays "Places")
  /app/crm/orgs stays

## B3) REMOVE DUPLICATE CONTACTS SURFACES (LINK, DON'T DELETE)
Business nav has /app/customers and CRM has /app/crm/people.
We want ONE obvious place users click: Contacts.

Implement:
- Keep /app/crm/people as the canonical Contacts list
- In /app/customers page, replace the body with either:
  (a) redirect to /app/crm/people, OR
  (b) a simple "Contacts moved" card with button to /app/crm/people
Do NOT delete /app/customers route in this pass.

## B4) VERIFICATION REQUIRED
- Sidebar shows Work Requests + Projects for both tenant types
- No nav item says "Catalog" anymore (it says Inventory)
- /app/customers no longer acts like a separate CRM list
- All routes load with no console errors

## RULES
- Do not rename DB tables.
- Do not rename routes in App.tsx.
- Do not restructure CRM.
Return a completion report with files changed and grep counts for:
- "Catalog" occurrences (should be 0 in nav labels)
- "Customers" occurrences in nav labels (should be 0)
- "People" occurrences in nav labels (should be 0)
