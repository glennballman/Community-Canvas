REPLIT PROMPT — P-UI-13A Participant "My Trips" (Corrected)
You are implementing Community Canvas V3.5 (additive-only; no refactors).
Goal: Complete Participant UX: "My Trips" view + trip detail.

HARD RULE: Never use "book/booking" anywhere — routes, UI copy, variable names, comments. Use "reserve/reservation" only.

1) INVENTORY FIRST (in-repo):
- Find existing trips-related tables + routes.
- Identify any participant-facing endpoints already present (search for "trips", "itinerary", "participants", "trip_itinerary_items").
- Confirm public reservation flow already writes reservation_id into trip itinerary items.
- If any existing columns or variables use "book/booked" terminology, note them for the terminology remediation backlog but do NOT refactor them in this prompt — just map them to "reserved" in API responses.

2) API (only if missing):
Create/extend ONLY the minimal participant endpoints required:
- GET /api/p2/app/participant/trips
  Returns participant's trips summary list (id, title, date range, status, primary location, counts).
- GET /api/p2/app/participant/trips/:tripId
  Returns trip details including itinerary items. For each item return:
    - isReserved (boolean) — mapped from DB, regardless of underlying column name
    - reservationId
    - dayDate/time
    - title
    - description
    - location
- If needed, GET /api/p2/app/participant/trips/:tripId/reservations
  Returns linked reservations/folios for that trip (summary only; no ledger mutation).

All endpoints must:
- Respect portal scoping and participant membership.
- Use standard API envelope { ok, error?, ...data }.
- Be read-only.
- Return "isReserved" in responses (never "isBooked").

3) UI:
Add new participant routes under /app/participant:
- /app/participant/trips (MyTripsPage)
- /app/participant/trips/:tripId (TripDetailPage)

UI requirements:
- Shows upcoming vs past trips.
- Trip card shows date range, destination, status, and "View trip".
- Trip detail shows itinerary grouped by day.
- Each itinerary item shows a "Reserved" badge if linked reservation exists.
- If reservationId exists, show "View reservation" link that navigates to existing reservation/folio UI if present; otherwise show a neutral placeholder (no dead route).
- All UI copy must use "reservation/reserved" terminology — never "booking/booked".

4) NAV / RBAC:
- Add "My Trips" to participant nav only.
- Ensure operator/host nav unchanged.

5) TERMINOLOGY GUARDRAIL:
- Before completing, grep all new/changed files for "book" or "booking".
- If any found in UI copy, routes, or variable names exposed to users, fix them.
- If found only in internal DB column mappings, note them in output for remediation backlog.

6) QA:
- Add a lightweight e2e dev smoke step in existing qa-smoke-test or cert script that:
  - loads /app/participant/trips
  - loads first trip detail page if any trips exist
  
Return a short report of:
- Files changed
- New routes created
- Any terminology violations found (and whether fixed or backlogged)
- Smoke test results
