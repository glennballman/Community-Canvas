You are auditing Community Canvas / CivOS V3.5. DO NOT implement or change anything. Inventory only.

Goal: produce an authoritative, repo-truth inventory of ALL V3.5 UI, including:
- every UI route/page file
- every navigation definition (portal app nav, tenant admin nav, platform admin nav, public nav)
- role gating and context gating (tenant_id / portal_id / circle_id required)
- which features are reachable vs only via direct URL
- a consolidated "How do I get to X?" index for all major subsystems

Write outputs into ./proof/v3.5/ as markdown files.

========================
PART A — ROUTE INVENTORY
========================
1) Enumerate all routes registered in client routing:
   - Find the main router file (client/src/App.tsx or equivalent)
   - List every Route path and the component/page file it renders
   - Capture role/guard wrappers (RequireAuth, RequireTenant, portal context, etc.)
2) Enumerate all page files:
   - grep for client/src/pages/**/*.tsx
   - classify each into:
     - Public
     - Portal App (/app/*)
     - Tenant Admin (/app/admin/* or similar)
     - Platform Admin (/admin or /app/platform/*)
     - Dev-only (/app/dev/*)
3) Output: proof/v3.5/ui-routes-inventory.md
   Include a table: route | page file | shell | guards | notes

=============================
PART B — NAVIGATION INVENTORY
=============================
1) Locate ALL nav config sources:
   - client/src/lib/routes/v3Nav.ts (portal nav)
   - tenant admin nav config file(s)
   - platform admin nav config file(s)
   - public nav (marketing/public portal)
2) For each nav:
   - list sections + items in order
   - each item: label | icon | href | gating conditions
3) Output: proof/v3.5/ui-nav-inventory.md
   Include separate sections for:
   - Portal App Nav
   - Tenant Admin Nav
   - Platform Admin Nav
   - Public Nav

=========================================
PART C — ROLE-TO-NAV VISIBILITY MATRIX
=========================================
1) Identify the role model used for gating:
   - tenant roles (tenant admin/owner/operator/etc.)
   - portal roles (portal admin/member/etc.)
   - participant roles (participant/applicant/etc.)
   - platform admin role
2) For each role, compute which nav items appear AND which routes are accessible.
   - If gating is dynamic (depends on modules or portal type), note that.
3) Output: proof/v3.5/ui-role-nav-matrix.md
   Format:
   Role -> visible nav items
   Role -> accessible routes
   Role -> required context (tenant/portal/circle)

=================================
PART D — SUBSYSTEM UI COVERAGE
=================================
Subsystems to inventory (at minimum):
- Reservations (public + portal)
- Availability / Proposal / Hold / Confirm loop (public)
- Participant Trips
- Messaging
- Notifications
- Jobs (job advertisements/postings + applications + applicant messaging)
- Service Runs
- Work Requests / Procurement Requests
- Assets / Capability Units
- Operations Board
- Housekeeping tasks + task photos
- Fleet manager UX
- Circles CRUD + delegations
- Admin (roles/settings/folios)
- Platform (tenants/analytics/cert status)
- Media (DevMediaPage + any embedded uses)

For each subsystem:
- UI routes/pages
- left-nav entry point (if any)
- primary CTAs (where to create/list/manage)
- missing discoverability (exists but not linked)
Output: proof/v3.5/ui-subsystem-coverage.md

==========================================
PART E — “HOW DO I…?” OPERATOR INDEX
==========================================
Create a user-facing index mapping common intents -> exact navigation steps / URLs.
Include at least:
- Post a job advertisement
- View job applicants
- Create a service run
- Open bidding / collect signups
- Create a reservation (manual)
- View/manage reservations
- View operations board occupancy
- Message a contractor
- Message a job applicant
- Upload media to a bid
- Upload photos to a housekeeping task
- Manage fleet assets + maintenance
- Create a circle + add members + delegate
- View folios + ledger entries
- Adjust portal settings
- Platform: view tenants + analytics + cert status

Output: proof/v3.5/ui-how-to-index.md

=================================
PART F — DISCOVERABILITY GAPS
=================================
Without changing code, produce a delta list:
- Routes that exist but have no nav entry
- Nav entries that point to missing routes
- Features that require portal context but are reachable only from tenant/platform shells
- Duplicate or confusing labels (e.g., Jobs vs Work Requests vs Service Runs)
Output: proof/v3.5/ui-discoverability-gaps.md

=================================
DELIVERABLE SUMMARY
=================================
Write proof/v3.5/ui-inventory-summary.md that links to the five files above and gives:
- counts (routes/pages/nav items)
- the top 10 discoverability blockers
- recommended navigation normalization plan (NO IMPLEMENTATION, just proposal bullets)
