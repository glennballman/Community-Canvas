I'm uploading a JSON file with 1,100 BC webcams to import. The file is at data/Webcams_1100_All_of_BC.json

1. First, create the webcam entity type:

INSERT INTO entity_types (id, category_id, name, name_plural, description, icon, fields_schema) VALUES
('webcam', 'environment', 'Webcam', 'Webcams', 'Traffic and highway webcams across BC', 'camera', '{
  "direct_feed_url": "string",
  "host_page_url": "string", 
  "view_description": "string",
  "source_provider": "string",
  "live_feed_status": "string",
  "direction": "string"
}')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  name = EXCLUDED.name,
  description = EXCLUDED.description,
  fields_schema = EXCLUDED.fields_schema;

2. Create an import script that reads the JSON file and for each webcam in the "webcams" array:

Create an entity with:
- slug = generate from nickname (e.g., "webcam-coquihalla-great-bear-n")
- name = webcam.nickname (e.g., "Coquihalla Great Bear Snowshed - N")
- entity_type_id = "webcam"
- region_id = try to match webcam.city to a geo_region, fallback to "bc"
- latitude = webcam.latitude
- longitude = webcam.longitude
- website = webcam.host_page_url
- metadata = JSON with:
  - direct_feed_url = webcam.direct_feed_url
  - view_description = webcam.view_description
  - source_provider = webcam.source_provider
  - live_feed_status = webcam.live_feed_status
  - Extract direction from nickname if present (N, S, E, W)

The JSON structure is:
{
  "webcams": [
    {
      "latitude": 49.596374,
      "longitude": -121.159832,
      "city": "Coquihalla",
      "nickname": "Coquihalla Great Bear Snowshed - N",
      "view_description": "Highway 5 at the Great Bear Snowshed, looking north.",
      "host_page_url": "https://images.drivebc.ca/bchighwaycam/pub/html/www/2.html",
      "direct_feed_url": "https://images.drivebc.ca/bchighwaycam/pub/cameras/2.jpg",
      "source_provider": "DriveBC (BC Ministry of Transportation)",
      "live_feed_status": "online"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Process in batches of 200 to avoid timeouts.

After import, verify:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entities WHERE entity_type_id = 'webcam';
-- Expected: 1100

-- Check sample with feed URLs
SELECT name, latitude, longitude, metadata->>'direct_feed_url' as feed_url
FROM entities 
WHERE entity_type_id = 'webcam'
LIMIT 5;
