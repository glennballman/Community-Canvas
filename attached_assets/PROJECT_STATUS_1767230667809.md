# BC COMMUNITY STATUS DASHBOARD - PROJECT STATUS CAPSULE
## Last Updated: December 31, 2024

---

# 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

## What We're Building
A comprehensive **BC Community Status Dashboard** that integrates with **CivOS** (Civilization OS), a sovereign-grade governmental operating system launching January 5th. The system bridges local community intelligence with government-level decision making.

## Dual Purpose
1. **AI-Powered Trip Planning** - Complex routing considering ferries, road conditions, weather, accommodation, equipment requirements
2. **Government Emergency Operations** - Real-time community-level intelligence for decision making

## User Profile
- **Glenn** - Experienced tech executive, hasn't coded for 25 years
- **Prefers GUI-based development** (Replit)
- **Primary environment**: Replit with PostgreSQL

## Key Integration
- **CivOS Launch**: January 5th
- **Integration Method**: Cursor-based synchronization with provenance tracking
- **Data Export**: Real-time signals to government systems

# 📋 PHASE 47 - IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

## Database Schema Additions

### 1. Extend trailer_type_enum
Add all new types from comprehensive list above.

```sql
is_overlander BOOLEAN
ground_clearance_inches INTEGER
suspension_type_offroad VARCHAR(30)
articulating_hitch BOOLEAN
has_rooftop_tent_mount BOOLEAN
has_slide_out_kitchen BOOLEAN
has_rock_sliders BOOLEAN
has_recovery_points BOOLEAN
```

### 3. Tiny Home fields (trailer_profiles)
```sql
is_tiny_home BOOLEAN
thow_certification VARCHAR(30)  -- rvia, noah, none
thow_square_feet INTEGER
thow_four_season BOOLEAN
registered_as VARCHAR(30)  -- rv, travel_trailer, utility_trailer
```

### 4. Specialty Equipment fields (trailer_profiles)
```sql
is_specialty_equipment BOOLEAN
equipment_type VARCHAR(50)
equipment_make VARCHAR(100)
equipment_power_type VARCHAR(30)
equipment_hp INTEGER
requires_setup_time BOOLEAN
setup_time_minutes INTEGER
has_outriggers BOOLEAN
-- Plus type-specific: sawmill_max_log_diameter, welder_amp_rating, etc.
```

### 5. Driver qualifications (participant_profiles)
```sql
license_class VARCHAR(10)
license_province VARCHAR(20)
license_expiry DATE
has_air_brake_endorsement BOOLEAN
has_house_trailer_endorsement BOOLEAN
has_heavy_trailer_endorsement BOOLEAN
heavy_trailer_medical_expiry DATE
max_trailer_weight_certified_kg INTEGER
fifth_wheel_experience BOOLEAN
gooseneck_experience BOOLEAN
horse_trailer_experience BOOLEAN
boat_launching_experience BOOLEAN
```

### 6. New reference tables
- `provincial_towing_regulations` - Weight limits, endorsements by province
- `trailer_type_master` - Complete reference with specs, ferry classification

### 7. Compatibility function
```sql
check_driver_trailer_qualification(driver_id, trailer_id, province)
-- Returns: is_qualified, issues[], warnings[], required_endorsements[]
```

## UI Updates

### TrailerForm Enhancements
- Add all new trailer categories to selector
- Conditional sections based on category:
  - Horse: stall config, LQ amenities
  - Overlander: off-road specs, rooftop tent
  - Tiny Home: certification, square footage
  - Specialty: equipment-specific fields
  - Heavy: deck configuration, RGN options

### Driver Profile Enhancements
- License information section
- Endorsements with dates/expiry
- Experience checkboxes
- Training certifications

### Compatibility Checking
- Auto-check driver qualification when assigning to trailer
- Warning badges for missing endorsements
- Medical expiry alerts

---

# 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Create `/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`** in Replit (this file)
2. **Start new chat** for Phase 47 implementation
3. **In new chat, say**: "Read /docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md and let's implement Phase 47"

## Phase 47 Priority Order
1. Database migrations (add new columns/tables)
2. Seed provincial_towing_regulations (BC, AB)
3. Seed trailer_type_master reference data
4. Update TrailerForm with new categories
5. Add driver qualification fields to participant form
6. Implement compatibility checking function
7. Add warning badges to Fleet Dashboard

---

# 🔑 KEY DECISIONS MADE

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Horse LQ trailers are NOT RVs | Primary function is hauling horses - California DMV explicit |
| Tiny Homes need RVIA/NOAH cert | Required for RV parks, insurance, resale |
| 4,600 kg is BC threshold | Matches ICBC licensing requirements |
| Store driver endorsements with dates | Medical expires every 3 years for heavy |
| Track double-tow experience | Legal in AB/SK/MB but not BC |
| Include specialty equipment | Sawmills, welders are common in rural BC |
| BC Ferry classification field | Needed for trip planning (overheight, dangerous goods) |

# 💡 ARCHITECTURE NOTES

## 10-Layer Data Model
Every entity should have:
1. **Identity** - What it is
2. **Configuration** - How it's set up
3. **Real-time Status** - Current state
4. **Capacity** - What it can handle
5. **Environmental Context** - Weather, conditions
6. **Pricing** - Costs, fees
7. **Demand Patterns** - Usage trends
8. **Reputation** - Ratings, reviews
9. **Connections** - Relationships to other entities
10. **Provenance** - Data source, freshness

## Critical Architectural Insight
> "Impressive frontend systems can mask fundamental data storage problems."

The discovery that extensive TypeScript code was serving as the primary data store rather than the database highlighted the importance of proper data architecture.

---
