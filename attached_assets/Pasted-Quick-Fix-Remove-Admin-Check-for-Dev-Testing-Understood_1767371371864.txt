Quick Fix: Remove Admin Check for Dev/Testing
Understood! Let's remove the auth barrier so you can test freely.
Make CivOS dashboard publicly accessible for development/testing.

Update client/src/pages/admin/CivOSDashboard.tsx - remove the admin check at the top of the component:

Find and DELETE these lines (around line 70-80):
```tsx
    if (user?.userType !== 'admin') {
        return (
            <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-900 flex items-center justify-center">
                <div className="text-red-400 text-xl">Admin access required</div>
            </div>
        );
    }
```

Also remove the unused `useAuth` import if no longer needed, or keep it if you want to show the user info.

The dashboard will now be accessible to anyone at `/admin/civos`.

Also, for the API endpoints that require auth for write operations (generate signals, resolve signals), let's make those public too for testing:

In server/routes/civos.ts, find and update these routes:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
router.post('/signals/generate', authenticateToken, async (req: AuthRequest, res: Response) => {

// AFTER:
router.post('/signals/generate', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
```
```typescript
// BEFORE:
router.post('/signals', authenticateToken, async (req: AuthRequest, res: Response) => {

// AFTER:
router.post('/signals', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
```
```typescript
// BEFORE:
router.put('/signals/:id/resolve', authenticateToken, async (req: AuthRequest, res: Response) => {

// AFTER:
router.put('/signals/:id/resolve', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
```
```typescript
// BEFORE:
router.get('/config', authenticateToken, async (req: AuthRequest, res: Response) => {

// AFTER:
router.get('/config', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
```

Change `AuthRequest` to `Request` in these function signatures and remove any `req.user` references (or make them optional).

After these changes, refresh `/admin/civos` and everything should work without login!
This removes all auth friction for your dev environment. The CivOS dashboard and all its functionality will be fully accessible for testing.
Once you've made the changes, hit refresh on /admin/civos and you should see the full dashboard with:

Stats cards
Signal list (empty until you click "Generate Signals")
Regional capacity sidebar
API endpoints reference
