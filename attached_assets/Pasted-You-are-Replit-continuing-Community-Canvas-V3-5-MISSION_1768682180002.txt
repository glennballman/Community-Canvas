MISSION
Ship a high-ROI concierge workflow for cold start:
- central coordinator (portal staff) triages applications fast
- employer can see pipeline statuses
- reply templates exist
- SLA indicators exist
No refactors. Additive UI + minimal data where necessary.

HARD RULES
- Never use banned terms.
- Preserve tenant/portal isolation and staff authorization.
- Use existing messaging/notification patterns where available; do not invent a parallel system.

STEP 0 — HARD CHECK (print first)
1) Show cc_job_applications statuses + any interview fields.
2) Identify any existing notifications/templates tables (107_notifications...).
3) Identify any portal staff/roles checks used in moderation endpoints.

STEP 1 — Minimal pipeline + notes (migration 146 if needed)
If not already present:
- Ensure cc_job_applications.status supports:
  new, reviewing, screened, interview, offered, accepted, rejected, withdrawn
(If enum exists, map; if text, enforce via CHECK with additive migration.)
Add:
- cc_job_application_events (append-only) if not already present:
  id, application_id, portal_id, tenant_id, actor_identity_id, event_type, note, created_at, metadata
RLS: portal staff sees portal apps; tenant sees their apps; service bypass.

STEP 2 — Staff UI: Coordinator Queue
Route: /app/portals/:portalId/applications (or best existing admin area)
Features:
- Filters: campaign, housing_needed, status, “needs reply”
- SLA badges:
  - New < 2h (green), 2–24h (yellow), >24h (red)
- Actions:
  - Change status
  - Assign to employer (if campaign bundle)
  - Add note
  - Send reply (template)

Reply UX:
- Choose template
- Fill merge fields (applicant name, employer, role, start date)
- “Send” uses existing messaging service if available; otherwise store as an event record + placeholder “sent” state.

STEP 3 — Employer UI: Applicant Pipeline
Route: /app/jobs/:jobId/applications
- List/kanban by status
- Quick actions: advance status, add note, send reply template
- Read-only access to bundle info (if from campaign apply)

STEP 4 — Templates (no refactor)
If notification templates exist, add job/application templates:
- acknowledgment (received)
- request more info
- invite to interview
- not selected
- housing follow-up
- work permit follow-up
Store templates in existing template system if present; else create minimal cc_message_templates (migration 146) scoped by tenant/portal.

STEP 5 — Tests
- Portal staff authorization for coordinator queue endpoints
- Tenant isolation for employer pipeline
STOP.
