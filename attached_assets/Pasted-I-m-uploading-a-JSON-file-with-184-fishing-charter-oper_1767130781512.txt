I'm uploading a JSON file with 184 fishing charter operators to import. The file is at data/Fishing_Charter_Operators_All_of_BC.json

1. First, create the fishing charter entity type:

INSERT INTO entity_types (id, category_id, name, name_plural, description, icon, fields_schema) VALUES
('fishing-charter', 'services', 'Fishing Charter', 'Fishing Charters', 'Sport fishing and charter boat operators', 'fish', '{
  "home_port": "string",
  "contact_people": "array",
  "social_media_links": "array",
  "email": "string"
}')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  name = EXCLUDED.name,
  description = EXCLUDED.description,
  fields_schema = EXCLUDED.fields_schema;

2. Create an import script that reads the JSON file and for each operator in "fishing_charter_operators" array:

Create an entity with:
- slug = generate from business_name (e.g., "fishing-rocky-point-charters")
- name = operator.business_name
- entity_type_id = "fishing-charter"
- region_id = parse location to match geo_region (extract city name like "Bamfield" → "alberni-clayoquot")
- latitude = null (no GPS in this data - will geocode later)
- longitude = null
- phone = operator.phone_number
- website = operator.website_url
- metadata = JSON with:
  - home_port = operator.location
  - email = operator.email
  - contact_people = operator.contact_people (array of {first_name, last_name, role})
  - social_media_links = extract URLs from operator.social_media_links array

The JSON structure is:
{
  "fishing_charter_operators": [
    {
      "business_name": "Rocky Point Charters",
      "location": "Bamfield, Vancouver Island, British Columbia",
      "website_url": "https://rockypointcharters.ca/",
      "phone_number": "(250) 728-3678",
      "email": "kbodaly@shaw.ca",
      "social_media_links": [{"value": "https://www.youtube.com/..."}],
      "contact_people": [{"first_name": "Ken", "last_name": "Bodaly", "role": "Owner/Operator"}]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

After import, verify:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entities WHERE entity_type_id = 'fishing-charter';
-- Expected: 184

-- Check sample
SELECT name, phone, website, metadata->>'home_port' as port
FROM entities 
WHERE entity_type_id = 'fishing-charter'
LIMIT 10;

-- Check which regions have charters
SELECT 
  gr.short_name as region,
  COUNT(e.id) as charters
FROM entities e
LEFT JOIN geo_regions gr ON e.region_id = gr.id
WHERE e.entity_type_id = 'fishing-charter'
GROUP BY gr.short_name
ORDER BY charters DESC;
