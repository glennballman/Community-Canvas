REPLIT PROMPT 1 — Portal QA Launchpad (MVP, No Fixtures)

Create a new admin-only page that lets a founder select a portal and instantly get click-to-open links for every public workflow, including dynamic keys (campaign keys, trip access codes, proposal pay tokens) without hunting.

UI Route + Nav

Add a new route in the tenant app:
/app/admin/portals/:portalId/qa → PortalQaLaunchpadPage

Add a “QA Launchpad” link/button from the existing Portals admin UI (where portals are listed or portal detail is shown). It should navigate to /app/admin/portals/${portalId}/qa.

Gate the page to: tenant_owner, tenant_admin, and platform_admin.

Page Behavior (MVP)

On load:

Read portalId from params.

Fetch portal record (must include id, slug, name).

Display portal header: portal name + slug.

Public Workflow Links (static)

Render a “Public Workflow Links” card with buttons that open in a new tab:

Portal Home: /p/${slug}

Portal Onboarding: /p/${slug}/onboarding

Portal Reserve: /p/${slug}/reserve

Jobs List: /b/${slug}/jobs

Dynamic Keys (no hunting)

Render a “Dynamic Keys” section with lists (each item is a link that opens in a new tab):

Campaign Apply Links

Query existing campaigns for this portal and list each campaignKey with:
/b/${slug}/apply/${campaignKey}

Trip Links

Query recent trips for this portal (or trips with portal_id = portalId) and list each accessCode with:
/trip/${accessCode}

Proposal Links

Query recent proposals with portal_id = portalId and list:

View: /p/proposal/${proposalId}

Pay: /p/proposal/${proposalId}/pay/${token} (only if token exists; if stored differently, show whatever pay token exists)

Data/API Requirements

Prefer reusing existing admin endpoints if present.

If any required read endpoints do not exist, add one tenant-scoped admin endpoint:
GET /api/p2/app/admin/portals/:portalId/qa returning:

{
  "ok": true,
  "portal": { "id": "...", "slug": "...", "name": "..." },
  "campaigns": [{ "id": "...", "campaignKey": "...", "title": "...", "status": "..." }],
  "trips": [{ "id": "...", "accessCode": "...", "status": "..." }],
  "proposals": [{ "id": "...", "title": "...", "status": "...", "payToken": "..." }]
}


Must enforce tenant scoping + RLS-safe access (only portals the tenant can administer; platform admin can access all).

UX Details

Add “Copy” icon button next to each link to copy URL to clipboard.

Add “Open all core links” button that opens: /p, /p/.../reserve, /b/.../jobs in separate tabs.

Must not use forbidden terminology; use “reserve/reservation”.

Acceptance

Founder can go to /app/admin/portals/:portalId/qa and see:

4 core public links

existing campaign apply links (with campaign keys)

existing trip links (with access codes)

existing proposal links (with pay tokens if any)

No hunting, no manual DB queries.
