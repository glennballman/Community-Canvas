✅ REPLIT PROMPT — Fix Legacy /admin/* Links in New Platform Admin UI

Paste exactly this to Replit:

REPLIT PROMPT — Remove Legacy /admin/* Links from New Platform Admin UI

Problem:
The new Platform Admin shell (/app/platform/*) is working, but in-page links (cards, CTAs, buttons) still point to legacy routes under /admin/*.
Clicking these links drops users into the old admin UI, breaking navigation consistency.

Goal:
Ensure all Platform Admin navigation and in-page links route exclusively through /app/platform/*.
The legacy /admin/* UI must no longer be reachable from the new UI.

1️⃣ Find all legacy /admin/* links (GLOBAL SEARCH)

Search the entire client codebase for:

"/admin/"
"/admin/system-explorer"
"/admin/tenants"
"/admin/analytics"
"/admin/settings"


This will likely appear in:

Dashboard cards

Analytics page CTAs

“View more” buttons

Stat cards

<a href> strings

navigate("/admin/...") calls

2️⃣ Replace legacy links with canonical Platform routes

Apply these replacements everywhere in the new Platform Admin UI:

Old Link	New Link
/admin/system-explorer	/app/platform/system-explorer
/admin/tenants	/app/platform/tenants
/admin/analytics	/app/platform/analytics
/admin/settings	/app/platform/settings
/admin/users	/app/platform/users

Rule:

If the user is in Platform Admin mode, all links MUST stay under /app/platform/*.

3️⃣ Use router navigation — NOT raw <a href>

Wherever possible:

Replace <a href="..."> with:

<NavLink to="/app/platform/system-explorer">


or

navigate("/app/platform/system-explorer")


This ensures:

no full page reload

layout remains mounted

left navigation stays intact

4️⃣ Fix the Analytics → System Explorer card specifically

In Platform Analytics page:

Locate the “System Explorer” card or CTA

It is currently linking to:

/admin/system-explorer


Change it to:

/app/platform/system-explorer


Verify:

URL changes correctly

PlatformLayout remains mounted

Left nav stays highlighted on “System Explorer”

5️⃣ Add a guardrail to prevent regression (VERY IMPORTANT)

Add a small dev-only assertion:

if (href?.startsWith("/admin/")) {
  console.error("❌ Legacy admin link detected:", href);
}


Or a lint comment / TODO note:

// DO NOT use /admin/* routes — use /app/platform/*


This prevents future contributors (or Replit itself) from re-introducing the bug.

6️⃣ Acceptance Criteria (must all pass)

Clicking System Explorer from Analytics stays inside /app/platform

URL never changes to /admin/*

Platform left nav remains visible

No legacy admin UI is reachable from new UI

Global search shows zero /admin/ links inside Platform Admin pages

7️⃣ Deliverables

List of files where /admin/* links were replaced

Confirmation that Platform Analytics, Dashboard, and Tenants cards route correctly
