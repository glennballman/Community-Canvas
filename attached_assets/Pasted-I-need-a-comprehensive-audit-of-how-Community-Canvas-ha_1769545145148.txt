I need a comprehensive audit of how Community Canvas handles work orders, quotes, and invoices. Please examine the database schema and create a markdown document answering these questions.

### Part 1: Service Runs Analysis
```sql
-- 1a. Show cc_service_runs structure
\d cc_service_runs

-- 1b. Show any related service run tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE '%service_run%'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 1c. Show cc_sr_* tables (service run related?)
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'cc_sr_%'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 1d. Describe each cc_sr_* table
-- (run \d on each table found)
```

### Part 2: Projects Analysis
```sql
-- 2a. Show cc_projects structure
\d cc_projects

-- 2b. Show any project-related tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE '%project%'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

### Part 3: Quote/Estimate Analysis
```sql
-- 3a. Search for quote-related tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND (table_name LIKE '%quote%' OR table_name LIKE '%estimate%' OR table_name LIKE '%bid%')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 3b. Describe each quote-related table found
-- (run \d on each)

-- 3c. Check cc_catalog_items for quote/estimate types
SELECT DISTINCT item_type FROM cc_catalog_items;
```

### Part 4: Invoice/Billing Analysis
```sql
-- 4a. Search for invoice-related tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND (table_name LIKE '%invoice%' OR table_name LIKE '%billing%' OR table_name LIKE '%charge%')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 4b. Check wallet/ledger tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND (table_name LIKE '%wallet%' OR table_name LIKE '%ledger%' OR table_name LIKE '%payment%' OR table_name LIKE '%transaction%')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 4c. Describe each financial table found
-- (run \d on key tables)
```

### Part 5: Work Assignment Flow
```sql
-- 5a. How do operators get assigned to work?
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND (table_name LIKE '%assign%' OR table_name LIKE '%dispatch%' OR table_name LIKE '%schedule%')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 5b. Check cc_operators relationships
\d cc_operators

-- 5c. Any work request tables?
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND (table_name LIKE '%work%' OR table_name LIKE '%request%' OR table_name LIKE '%order%')
ORDER BY table_name;
```

### Part 6: Reservation vs Service Run Relationship
```sql
-- 6a. Do reservations link to service runs?
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'cc_reservations'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 6b. Do service runs link to reservations?
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'cc_service_runs'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

### Output Request

Create a markdown document called `schema-audit-work-quotes-invoices.md` that includes:

1. **Work Order Flow**: How does CC capture "a contractor gets dispatched to do work"? Which tables are involved?

2. **Service Runs Purpose**: What exactly are `cc_service_runs` and `cc_sr_*` tables used for?

3. **Projects Purpose**: What are `cc_projects` used for? How do they differ from service runs?

4. **Quotes/Estimates**: Where do quotes live? Is there a quotes table or are they part of another system?

5. **Invoices/Billing**: Where do invoices live? Are they in the wallet/ledger system or separate tables?

6. **Recommended Capability Domains**: Based on this audit, what should the authorization framework's capability domains be named?

Include the raw SQL output for each query so we can see the actual schema.
