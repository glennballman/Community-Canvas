Find and remove legacy API calls that are causing 404 errors. The diagnostic found old fetch calls to /api/weather and /api/ferry-status that no longer exist.

=== STEP 1: Find Legacy Calls ===

Search the entire client/src directory for these patterns:
- /api/weather
- /api/ferry-status
- /api/ferry
- fetchWeather
- fetchFerryStatus

Run this command and show me the results:
```bash
echo "=== Searching for legacy API calls ==="
grep -r "/api/weather" client/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" -n
grep -r "/api/ferry" client/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" -n
grep -r "fetchWeather" client/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" -n
grep -r "fetchFerryStatus" client/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" -n
```

=== STEP 2: Remove or Update Legacy Calls ===

For each file found:

1. If it's in JourneyView.tsx or RoadTripsTab.tsx:
   - The conditions are now fetched from `/api/v1/trips/:id/conditions`
   - Remove any separate weather/ferry fetch calls
   - Use the conditions response which already includes weather and ferry_status

2. If it's in Overview or other dashboard components:
   - These might be legitimate calls for the main dashboard
   - Check if there's a working endpoint or if it needs to use a different data source

=== STEP 3: Verify No Console Errors ===

After cleanup, the browser console should not show any 404 errors for API calls.

=== STEP 4: Add Whistler Webcam Note (Optional) ===

Since some Whistler webcams are video streams (not static images), we could add a small indicator. In the WebcamThumbnail component, when showing the placeholder for video streams:
```tsx
// If it's a video stream, show a different indicator
const isVideoStream = rawUrl && (rawUrl.includes('.m3u8') || rawUrl.includes('stream'));

// In the placeholder display:
{!imageUrl && (
  <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-gray-500">
    <span className="text-2xl">{isVideoStream ? '🎥' : '📷'}</span>
    {isVideoStream && <span className="text-xs mt-1">Live Video</span>}
  </div>
)}
```

=== EXPECTED OUTCOME ===

1. No more 404 errors in browser console
2. All data comes from the proper /api/v1/trips endpoints
3. Video stream webcams show a "Live Video" indicator instead of broken image

Show me what legacy calls you find and what changes you make.
