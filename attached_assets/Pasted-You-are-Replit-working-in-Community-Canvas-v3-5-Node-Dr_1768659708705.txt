You are Replit working in Community Canvas v3.5 (Node + Drizzle + Postgres/Neon). 
DO NOT implement anything yet.

TASK: Produce a HARD INVENTORY of what already exists for Jobs/Labor in the codebase and database.
We will use this to design and implement the full Jobs backend without refactors or collisions.

CRITICAL RULES
- Do not use the words “book” or “booking” anywhere in UI copy or comments. Use “reserve”/“reservation” only.
- Do not change existing reservation backend endpoints or tables.
- Output must include evidence: SQL results, file paths, and excerpts.

STEP 1 — Database inventory (run SQL in Neon)
1) List any existing jobs/labor tables:
   - tables with names like: job, jobs, labor, labour, worker, applicant, application, posting, hiring, recruit, offer, visa, credential
   Provide:
   - table_name, column_name, data_type for each match

2) Search for any existing enums/types related to jobs:
   - list pg_type where typname ILIKE '%job%' OR '%labor%' OR '%worker%' OR '%applic%'

3) Search for any existing RLS policies related to those tables:
   - show policies from pg_policies where tablename matches those results

4) Check for any existing storage/attachments tables:
   - tables like: attachment, file, upload, document, blob, media
   Provide schema and any RLS

5) Show current migrations list:
   - list migration filenames and the latest migration number

STEP 2 — Code inventory (repo scan)
1) Search the codebase for:
   - routes/endpoints containing '/jobs', 'job', 'application', 'applicant', 'hiring', 'offer', 'visa', 'worker'
2) Identify any Drizzle schema files that define anything job-related
3) Identify any UI routes/pages already created for jobs
4) Identify any existing email/SMS notification utilities that could be reused
5) Identify any existing auth/RLS helper patterns used by the reservation public API (we will mirror the pattern)

STEP 3 — Output format
Return a single report with:
A) Database Findings (with SQL + results)
B) Repo Findings (file paths + short excerpts)
C) Collision Risks (anything that might conflict with new Jobs backend)
D) Recommendation: “Safe to proceed” or “Not safe” and why

STOP after the report. Do NOT implement.
