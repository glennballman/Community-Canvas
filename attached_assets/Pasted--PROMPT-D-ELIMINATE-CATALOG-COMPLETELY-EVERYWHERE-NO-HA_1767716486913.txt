# PROMPT D — ELIMINATE "CATALOG" COMPLETELY (EVERYWHERE). NO HALF MEASURES.

We are removing the concept/word "Catalog" from the entire codebase.
Replace it with **Inventory** in:
- routes
- API endpoints
- database tables/types/enums
- filenames
- component names
- UI copy
- any internal identifiers that users/devs see

There is no production data yet. Do the rename cleanly.

## HARD RULES
1) After this change, `grep -Rin "catalog" .` must return **ZERO** matches (case-insensitive).
2) Do NOT invent new features. This is a rename/refactor only.
3) Keep behavior identical.

## SCOPE

### 1) Frontend Routes
- `/app/catalog` -> `/app/inventory`
Update:
- `client/src/App.tsx` routes
- navigation config in `client/src/layouts/TenantAppLayout.tsx`
- any links/buttons pointing to catalog

### 2) Frontend Pages / Components / Files
Rename files and components:
- `CatalogPage.tsx` -> `InventoryPage.tsx`
- Any components named `*Catalog*` -> `*Inventory*`

Update titles/subtitles to Inventory.

### 3) Backend API
Rename endpoints:
- `/api/catalog/*` -> `/api/inventory/*` (or whatever current pattern is)
Update server routes + client API callers.

### 4) Database: tables/types
If any tables/types contain `catalog` in their name, rename them:
- Use `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO ...`
- Use `ALTER TYPE ... RENAME TO ...` if needed
- Rename sequences/indexes if they contain catalog

If the system currently uses generic table names like `items`, keep them. Only remove `catalog` where it appears.

### 5) Migration strategy
Create a new migration file: `0XX_rename_catalog_to_inventory.sql` that:
- Renames tables/types if they exist (safe guards)
- Updates views/functions referencing old names
- Leaves the DB consistent

### 6) Verification (mandatory)
Provide in your reply:
A) The output of:
- `grep -Rin "catalog" client server | head -n 200` (should output nothing)
- `grep -Rin "Catalog" client server | head -n 200` (should output nothing)
B) The list of files renamed
C) Confirmation that app boots and inventory page loads at `/app/inventory`
D) Confirmation that old `/app/catalog` does NOT exist (or optionally redirects to inventory — choose ONE and state it)

## DO NOT
- add new inventory capabilities
- change the booking behavior
- change data models beyond renaming catalog references

Proceed now.
