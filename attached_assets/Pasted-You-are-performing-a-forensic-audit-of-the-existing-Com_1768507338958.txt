You are performing a forensic audit of the existing Community Canvas codebase to surface the full V1 “Jobber + CompanyCam replacement” subsystem (bids/estimates, quotes, work orders, job execution, timesheets, field photos, change orders, invoicing hooks, approvals).

Goal: Produce an authoritative inventory of what already exists (DB schema + API routes + services + UI routes) so we can incorporate it into the V3 inventory deliverables and avoid duplicate systems.

1) Output required (must be concrete, file-backed)

Return a report with these sections, each backed by file paths and table/column names:

Data Model Map (tables + columns)

List all cc_* tables related to: bids/estimates/quotes, proposals, work orders, jobs/projects, tasks, timesheets/time entries, labor, materials, photos/media, notes, approvals/signatures, invoices/line items, change orders, disputes/chargebacks.

For each table: key columns + FKs + RLS status (enabled/forced) if present in migrations.

API Surface Map (server routes)

List all routes touching the above objects (method + path + purpose)

Include file paths: server/routes/*.ts and any server/services/*.ts.

UI Surface Map (client routes/pages/components)

List all relevant pages and routes under client/src/pages/** and navigation entries that expose this functionality.

Workflow Coverage

For each workflow: “Estimate → Bid → Approval → Work Order → Time/Photos → Change Order → Completion → Invoice/Settlement”

Mark: ✅ implemented end-to-end / ⚠ partial / ❌ missing

Integration Hooks

Identify any existing connectors for: payments, invoicing, accounting, exports, attachments storage, R2 keys, etc.

Overlap / Collision Risks with V3

Identify where this V1 subsystem overlaps with V3:

reservations vs bookings

jobs wedge

record bundles / notes

CAPs/service runs

Recommend “reuse vs refactor vs deprecate” without implementing anything.

2) Mandatory evidence rules

Do not guess. Every claim must include at least one of:

table name + relevant columns

migration file reference

route path + file reference

UI route + file reference

3) How to do the audit (required steps)

Perform these steps and include the results:

Search shared/schema.ts for keywords:
estimate, quote, bid, proposal, work_order, job, project, task, time, timesheet, time_entry, labor, material, line_item, invoice, change_order, attachment, media, photo, companycam, jobber.

Search server/routes and server/services for the same keywords.

Search client/src/pages and client/src/components for the same keywords plus nav labels (“Jobs”, “Work Orders”, “Timesheets”, “Estimates”, “Bids”).

Search server/migrations for table creation and RLS policies related to this subsystem.

4) Deliverable format

Output as docs/audits/V1_JOBBER_COMPANYCAM_FORENSIC_AUDIT.md with:

Executive summary (10 bullets max)
