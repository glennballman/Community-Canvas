You are validating Community Canvas / CivOS V3.5 for platform completion.
Do NOT implement features. Proof + verification only.

Goal: Produce a final completion artifact at:
proof/v3.5/final-completion.md
and ensure certification outputs are current.

PART A — RUN CERTIFICATION SUITE
1) Run the existing V3.5 certification script (the one that generates proof bundles).
2) Confirm:
- terminology scan = 0 violations (no “book/booking” anywhere)
- invariants: ledger immutability assumptions hold
- portal scoping checks pass
- route inventory generation succeeds
Write the exact command used and the PASS/FAIL results.

PART B — UI COVERAGE MAP (Role → Routes)
Generate an explicit matrix:
Roles:
- Guest/Public
- Participant
- Host
- Operator
- Crew
- Fleet Manager
- Tenant Admin
- Platform Admin

For each role:
- list visible nav sections
- list registered routes/pages under /app and public routes
- mark each as ✅ implemented with file path

PART C — API COVERAGE MAP (Subsystem → Endpoints)
Group endpoints by subsystem and list:
- Reservations / Holds / Risk
- Folios / Ledger
- Messaging / Conversations
- Notifications
- Jobs + Applicant messaging
- Circles
- Fleet
- Housekeeping
- Admin
- Platform

For each group:
- list routes + methods
- identify auth model (session/tenant/platform)
- identify scoping primitive (tenant_id/portal_id/circle_id)

PART D — WORKFLOW COMPLETION CHECKLIST (Shippable Flows)
Create a checklist (✅/⚠️) for these flows, referencing UI routes + endpoints:
1) Public: Availability → Proposal → Hold → Invite → Split Pay → Confirm
2) Participant: My Trips → Trip detail
3) Messaging: /app/messages + notifications + unread badges + mark-read
4) Jobs: Applicant applies → My Applications → Threaded messaging with operator
5) Circles: create → add member → delegate → revoke
6) Fleet: dashboard → asset detail → maintenance create
7) Housekeeping: task detail → before/after/issue photos upload
8) Admin: roles → settings → folios list/detail
9) Platform: tenants list/detail → analytics → cert status card

PART E — OUTPUT ARTIFACTS
Write final-completion.md with:
- Build identifier (git SHA if available)
- Certification results summary
- Role/Route matrix
- Subsystem/API matrix
- Workflow checklist
- Known limitations (only if evidence-based; no speculation)
- Links/paths to supporting proof files in ./proof/v3.5/

Do not add new code. Only generate the proof doc and ensure existing proof outputs are up to date.

END.
