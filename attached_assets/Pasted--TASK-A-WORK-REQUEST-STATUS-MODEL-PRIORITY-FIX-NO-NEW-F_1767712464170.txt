# TASK A: WORK REQUEST STATUS MODEL + PRIORITY FIX (NO NEW FEATURES)

You will ONLY implement what is listed below. Do NOT add pages, features, tables, or new concepts.

## A1) WORK REQUEST STATUS FINAL SET
Replace the current work_request_status enum values:
CURRENT: ('new','contacted','quoted','converted','closed','spam')
TARGET:  ('new','contacted','quoted','booked','completed','dropped','spam')

Mappings for existing data:
- converted -> booked
- closed -> completed
- spam stays spam

## A2) RENAME "Converted" -> "Booked" EVERYWHERE
This includes:
- UI tabs
- UI labels/buttons ("Convert" becomes "Book" / "Mark Booked")
- API validation / mappings
- Any status config maps
- Any filters or queries
- Any tests/docs if present

## A3) END-OF-LIFE STATUSES
Replace "Closed" usage in Work Requests with:
- "Completed" (work done)
- "Dropped" (won’t do)

## A4) PRIORITY VS URGENCY (BUG FIX)
The DB uses `priority`. UI currently shows "Urgency" and reads `request.urgency`.
Fix this:
- Remove `urgency` from WorkRequest types/interfaces and API payloads.
- UI label must be "Priority"
- UI must read/write `request.priority`
- Ensure the WorkRequestDetail page and any forms persist `priority`

Search targets:
client/src/pages/intake/WorkRequestDetail.tsx
client/src/pages/intake/WorkRequestsList.tsx
server/routes work-requests endpoints
shared types if any

## A5) VERIFICATION REQUIRED (must report)
1) Grep proof (excluding historical migrations):
- "converted" status usage only appears in migration history, not active code
- "Urgency" label removed from Work Requests UI (0 matches in intake pages)
2) API smoke tests:
- GET /api/work-requests?status=new|contacted|quoted|booked|completed|dropped|spam works
- PUT /api/work-requests/:id can set status to each allowed value
- priority is present in responses and updates correctly
3) UI smoke:
- Tabs render: New / Contacted / Quoted / Booked / Completed / Dropped / All
- Empty states still work
- No console errors

## RULES
- Do not rename other sections (Inventory/Catalog etc.) in this prompt.
- Do not change Projects statuses.
Return a completion report with files changed + grep counts + endpoints tested.
