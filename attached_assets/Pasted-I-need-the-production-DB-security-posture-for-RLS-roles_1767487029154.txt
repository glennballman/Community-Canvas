I need the production DB security posture for RLS, roles, and ownership (no summaries).

Deliverables:

A) Identify the exact DB role used by the application at runtime
- What username/role does the API connect as in production and in dev?
- Confirm it is NOT a superuser.
- Confirm whether it is the OWNER of any tenant-scoped tables.

B) Run and paste the output of these SQL queries (run as the same role the API uses, not as postgres/db owner):

1) Who am I / am I superuser?
SELECT
  current_user,
  session_user,
  current_setting('is_superuser', true) AS is_superuser_guc,
  rolsuper,
  rolbypassrls
FROM pg_roles
WHERE rolname = current_user;

2) Table ownership + RLS force status for key tables:
SELECT
  n.nspname AS schema,
  c.relname AS table,
  pg_get_userbyid(c.relowner) AS owner,
  c.relrowsecurity AS rls_enabled,
  c.relforcerowsecurity AS rls_forced
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
WHERE c.relkind = 'r'
  AND c.relname IN (
    'tenant_vehicles','tenant_trailers','tenant_vehicle_photos','tenant_trailer_photos',
    'catalog_claims','catalog_claim_evidence','catalog_claim_events',
    'assets','asset_capabilities'
  )
ORDER BY c.relname;

3) List RLS policies for the same tables:
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN (
  'tenant_vehicles','tenant_trailers','tenant_vehicle_photos','tenant_trailer_photos',
  'catalog_claims','catalog_claim_evidence','catalog_claim_events'
)
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

4) Prove RLS actually blocks tenant writes without service mode:
- Ensure GUCs are cleared, then attempt inserts and show the error.
DO $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM set_config('app.tenant_id','',true);
  PERFORM set_config('app.service_mode','',true);
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO catalog_claim_events (id, claim_id, event_type, payload)
    VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), gen_random_uuid(), 'created', '{}'::jsonb);
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'FAIL: insert unexpectedly succeeded';
  EXCEPTION WHEN others THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'PASS: insert blocked: %', SQLERRM;
  END;
END $$;

C) Based on the above, tell me whether we should add:
ALTER TABLE <...> FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
for the tenant_* and catalog_claim_* tables (yes/no, with reasons).

Important: run these checks using the same DB role and connection path the API uses in production. If you cannot simulate that, explain exactly why and provide the closest equivalent.
