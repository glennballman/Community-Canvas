o how do I create a booking?

From what’s on your screen, booking creation is almost certainly done from the Calendar, not from the list view you’re currently on.

Create a booking (the intended flow)

Go to Bookings (left nav)

Click Calendar View (top-right button)

In the calendar:

Click + drag to select a time window (or click a day/time slot)

A “New Booking” drawer/modal should open. Fill:

Customer (pick existing or “Add new”)

What is being booked (Cabin / Parking Spot / F550 Truck / Lucky Lander, etc.)

Start / End (or the preset like half-day)

Status (Pending / Confirmed)

Click Create / Save / Confirm.

If Calendar View doesn’t let you click-to-create

Try these two places (common wiring patterns):

Inventory → click an item (e.g., F550 Truck) → “Book” / “Create booking”

Operations Board → click empty grid → “Add booking” / “New reservation” (sometimes hidden behind Add Block)

Quick reality check

If you click Calendar View and there’s no obvious “Create booking” on click/drag, tell me what you see (even 1 sentence like “calendar opens but clicking does nothing” / “it only shows existing bookings”). Then I’ll give you the exact prompt to make Replit wire the creation action in the right place (without adding new features).

Clicking Calendar view does nothing

Got it — that means the Bookings “Calendar View” button is either not wired, or it routes to a path that doesn’t exist / fails silently.

Here’s what to do right now (fast) and then the exact Replit prompt to prevent this class of “dead UI” going forward.

60-second check (so Replit has evidence)

Do these while on /app/bookings:

Right-click → Inspect → Console

Click Calendar View

See if any error shows (even a tiny one)

Look at the URL bar

Click Calendar View

Does the URL change at all? (e.g. adds ?view=calendar or goes to /app/bookings/calendar)

Network tab

Click Calendar View

Any navigation request? any JS error? any API call?

Even if you don’t report back, the prompt below forces Replit to instrument + fix properly.

Paste this into Replit (PROMPT: “NO MORE DEAD UI – Bookings Calendar + Create Booking”)

PROMPT
You are fixing a production-quality app. The user reports: Clicking “Calendar View” on /app/bookings does nothing (no visible response).

Rules

Do not add new features.

Do not redesign UI.

Do not rename routes.

Only: wire missing behavior, fix broken routing, add guardrails, and prove it with evidence.

Goal

The Calendar View button must always do something deterministic:

Either toggles the bookings page into calendar mode, OR navigates to an existing calendar route.

In calendar mode, the user must be able to create a booking by clicking or click-dragging a time range.

If booking creation isn’t implemented yet, add a minimal “Create Booking” modal/drawer that calls the existing booking create endpoint (no new endpoints).

Step A — Ground truth and instrumentation (required)

Locate the “Calendar View” button component on /app/bookings.

Add temporary dev logging (console.debug) that prints:

“BookingsCalendarView clicked”

current pathname + querystring

the branch taken (toggle vs navigate)

Confirm the click handler actually fires.

Step B — Fix the Calendar View behavior (choose ONE canonical approach)

Option 1 (preferred): Toggle state in the same page:

Use a view state ("list" | "calendar") derived from a query param ?view=calendar so refresh is stable.

Clicking Calendar View sets view=calendar.

Add a “List View” control (can be subtle) to go back.

Option 2: Navigate to a route:

If a route exists (e.g. /app/bookings/calendar), ensure it is registered in the router and renders.

If it does not exist, create it as a thin wrapper around the same Bookings page with calendar mode enabled.

Step C — Calendar grid + booking creation

Render bookings on a simple calendar grid (day/week is fine; no new design).

Implement create booking interaction:

Click empty slot OR click-drag time range → opens “New Booking” modal

Fields: asset/resource, customer, starts_at, ends_at, status

Use existing data sources already shown in list view (assets/resources + customers)

Submit calls the existing booking create API used elsewhere in the app.

On success: close modal and refetch bookings.

Step D — Guardrails (no more “dead click”)

If calendar mode cannot render (missing data), show a clear inline error with a trace id (use existing error handling pattern).

Add an automated UI smoke check (dev only is fine):

loads /app/bookings

clicks “Calendar View”

asserts URL or view state changes

asserts calendar root element exists

Step E — Evidence (required output)

List the exact files changed.

Show console logs proving click handler fires and state/route changes.

Show a screenshot or log showing the calendar view rendered.

Show a successful booking create call (HTTP 200) and that it appears in list and operations board.
