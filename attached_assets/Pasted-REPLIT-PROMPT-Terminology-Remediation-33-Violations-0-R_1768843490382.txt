REPLIT PROMPT — Terminology Remediation (33 Violations → 0)
ROLE: Platform engineer fixing terminology compliance.
HARD RULE: Replace "book/booking" with "reserve/reservation" — mechanical rename only, no logic changes.
Goal
Zero out the 33 terminology violations so tsx scripts/v35-cert.ts passes with no red flags.

A) Route Renames
Old PatternNew Pattern/api/rentals/:id/book/api/rentals/:id/reserve/api/*/booking/api/*/reservation/api/*/bookings/api/*/reservations
If backwards compatibility is needed temporarily, add route aliases but ensure primary is the new term.

B) Payload Key Renames
OldNewbookingIdreservationIdbooking_idreservation_idbooked_atreserved_atis_bookedis_reservedbooking_statusreservation_status

C) UI Copy Renames
OldNew"Book Your Stay""Reserve Your Stay""Book Now""Reserve Now""Booking""Reservation""Booking Confirmation""Reservation Confirmation""Booked""Reserved""Your Booking""Your Reservation"

D) Component/File Renames (if applicable)
OldNewBookingCard.tsxReservationCard.tsxBookingDetails.tsxReservationDetails.tsxuseBooking.tsuseReservation.tsbooking.tsreservation.ts
Update all imports accordingly.

E) Database Columns (if any exist)
Check for columns named booking*. If found:
sql-- Migration to rename booking columns
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN booking_id TO reservation_id;

F) Allowlist (schema.org URLs only)
If the scan flags schema.org URLs containing "booking", add the allowlist marker:
typescript// ALLOW_BOOKING_TERM_URL_ONLY
const schemaType = "https://schema.org/LodgingReservation"; // Note: schema.org uses "Reservation" anyway

G) Verification
After all changes:
bashtsx scripts/v35-cert.ts
```

**Expected output:**
```
