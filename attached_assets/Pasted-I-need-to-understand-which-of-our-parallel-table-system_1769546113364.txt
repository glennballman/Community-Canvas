I need to understand which of our parallel table systems are actively used vs. deprecated.

### Part 1: Service Runs - Which Version is Active?
```sql
-- V1: cc_service_runs
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days') as created_last_90_days,
    MAX(created_at) as most_recent_created,
    MAX(updated_at) as most_recent_updated
FROM cc_service_runs;

-- V2: cc_sr_service_runs
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days') as created_last_90_days,
    MAX(created_at) as most_recent_created,
    MAX(updated_at) as most_recent_updated
FROM cc_sr_service_runs;

-- V3: cc_n3_runs
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days') as created_last_90_days,
    MAX(created_at) as most_recent_created,
    MAX(updated_at) as most_recent_updated
FROM cc_n3_runs;
```

### Part 2: Bids - Are Both Systems Active?
```sql
-- Procurement bids
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days') as created_last_90_days,
    MAX(created_at) as most_recent_created
FROM cc_bids;

-- Service run bids
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days') as created_last_90_days,
    MAX(created_at) as most_recent_created
FROM cc_sr_contractor_bids;
```

### Part 3: Check Foreign Key References
```sql
-- What tables reference cc_service_runs (V1)?
SELECT 
    tc.table_name as referencing_table,
    kcu.column_name as referencing_column,
    ccu.table_name as referenced_table
FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage ccu ON tc.constraint_name = ccu.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
  AND ccu.table_name IN ('cc_service_runs', 'cc_sr_service_runs', 'cc_n3_runs', 'cc_bids', 'cc_sr_contractor_bids');
```

### Part 4: Check API/Code References
```bash
# In the codebase, search for references to each table
grep -r "cc_service_runs" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l
grep -r "cc_sr_service_runs" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l
grep -r "cc_n3_runs" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l
grep -r "cc_bids" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l
grep -r "cc_sr_contractor_bids" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l
```

### Output Request

Create a markdown document `parallel-systems-audit.md` with:

1. **Row counts and activity** for each parallel system
2. **Foreign key dependencies** - what would break if we deprecated a table
3. **Code references** - which tables are actively used in code
4. **Recommendation** for each parallel system:
   - KEEP (actively used, canonical)
   - DEPRECATE (no longer used, can drop)
   - CONSOLIDATE (merge into another table)
   - CLARIFY (different purpose, both valid)
