# Pricing UI Lint - Forbidden Terms Reference

## Policy Summary
We are NOT anti-money UI. We ARE anti-upsell/checkout psychology and
anti-pricing in crisis/safety/operator workflows.

Currency is ALLOWED where users do accounting work (invoices, folios, quotes).
Currency is BLOCKED where it would pressure or derail safety, legal defensibility,
or authority trust.
