# THE BIG PICTURE

## What We're Really Building

This isn't just a fleet management system or a trip planner. It's a **comprehensive situational awareness and orchestration platform** that:

1. **Knows everything** about BC infrastructure, services, conditions, and capacity
2. **Understands context** - who's traveling, what they need, what could go wrong
3. **Handles 100% of everything** - from idea to reservations to monitoring to contingencies
4. **Watches continuously** - weather, road conditions, ferry cancellations, landslides, floods
5. **Adapts in real-time** - reroutes, rebooks, notifies when plans need to change

## The Promise
> "Tell us what you want to do. We handle everything else. You just show up and enjoy."

# PRIMARY USER PERSONAS

## 1. Pavel - The New Canadian (CivOS Integration)

### Background
Pavel is a new immigrant to Canada, recently landed in BC. English is his second language. He's overwhelmed by Canadian bureaucracy and doesn't know what he doesn't know.

### CivOS Vision
CivOS is the **sovereign-grade governmental operating system** launching January 5th. It's designed to be the single interface between citizens and ALL government services.

### Pavel's Journey with CivOS

**Day 1: Immigration & Settlement**
- CivOS guides through BC Services Card application
- Schedules MSP enrollment
- Explains SIN application process
- Connects to settlement services in his language

**Month 1: Getting Established**
- Driver's license process (what documents, which ICBC location, wait times)
- Banking requirements for newcomers
- Phone/internet setup guidance
- Finding housing (understanding BC tenancy laws)

**Ongoing: Life in BC**
- **Fishing License**: "I want to go fishing this weekend"
  - CivOS knows: license requirements, regional restrictions, catch limits
  - Handles: Online purchase, regulation summary, location recommendations
  - Monitors: Fishing closures, water conditions, fire bans affecting access

- **Hunting License**: Multi-step process
  - CORE exam scheduling
  - PAL application guidance
  - Species-specific licenses
  - Land access permissions (Crown land vs private)

- **Camping Reservations**: BC Parks, recreation sites
  - Knows capacity, reservation windows, cancellation policies
  - Handles reservation across multiple systems
  - Monitors: Fire bans, park closures, bear activity

- **Professional Licensing**: If Pavel is a tradesperson
  - Credential recognition process
  - Exam scheduling
  - Apprenticeship programs

### Key Insight
> Pavel doesn't need to know which government department handles what. CivOS knows, and our dashboard provides the real-time BC context that makes CivOS's guidance accurate and actionable.
